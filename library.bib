abstract = {Link adaptation techniques, where the modulation, coding rate, and/or other signal transmission parameters are dynamically adapted to the changing channel conditions, have recently emerged as powerful tools for increasing the data rate and spectral efficiency of wireless datacentric networks. While there has been significant progress on understanding the theoretical aspects of time adaptation in LA protocols, new challenges surface when dynamic transmission techniques are employed in broadband wireless networks with multiple signaling dimensions. Those additional dimensions are mainly frequency, especially in multicarrier systems, and space in multiple-antenna systems, particularly multi-array multiple-input multiple-output communication systems. In this article we give an overview of the challenges and promises of link adaptation in future broadband wireless networks. We suggest guidelines to help in the design of robust, complexity/cost-effective algorithms for these future wireless networks.},

abstract = {Day by day, there is increasing demand for high data rates it causes lack of radio spectrum for the new emerging technologies in the area of wireless communications. So, it is, must use spectrum efficiently, i.e. proper spectrum management. Spectrum management is responsible for the spectrum deficiency. In case of spectrum management it is must to accurate determination of the present licensed users. The Cognitive radio is a type of wireless communication. In this a transceiver can intelligently detect which communication channels are in active and which is inactive. As soon as it detects an unused channel it instantly move into vacant channels by avoiding busy channels. This results in optimization of the use of available radio-frequency spectrum with minimization of interference to other users. This paper includes the scenarios related to cognitive radio in wireless communication. It also focuses on primary user emulation attack with the maximum likelihood detector for various channels like AWGN, Rayleigh. Various evaluations are carried out to check the performance of cognitive radio with the help of MATLAB.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a fairness-aware rate maximization scheme for a wireless powered communications network (WPCN) assisted by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). The proposed scheme combines user scheduling based on time division multiple access (TDMA) and (mechanical) angular displacement of the IRS. Each energy harvesting user (EHU) has dedicated time slots with optimized durations for energy harvesting and information transmission whereas, the phase matrix of the IRS is adjusted to focus its beam to a particular EHU. The proposed scheme exploits the fundamental dependence of the IRS channel path-loss on the angle between the IRS and the node&#x2019;s line-of-sight, which is often overlooked in the literature. Additionally, the network design can be optimized for large number of IRS unit cells, which is not the case with the computationally intensive state-of-the-art schemes. In fact, the EHUs can achieve significant rates at practical distances of several tens of meters to the base station (BS) only if the number of IRS unit cells is at least a few thousand.},

@article{Mao2018,
abstract = {Space-division multiple access (SDMA) utilizes linear precoding to separate users in the spatial domain and relies on fully treating any residual multi-user interference as noise. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) uses linearly precoded superposition coding with successive interference cancellation (SIC) to superpose users in the power domain and relies on user grouping and ordering to enforce some users to fully decode and cancel interference created by other users. In this paper, we argue that to efficiently cope with the high throughput, heterogeneity of quality of service (QoS), and massive connectivity requirements of future multi-antenna wireless networks, multiple access design needs to depart from those two extreme interference management strategies, namely fully treat interference as noise (as in SDMA) and fully decode interference (as in NOMA). Considering a multiple-input single-output broadcast channel, we develop a novel multiple access framework, called rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). RSMA is a more general and more powerful multiple access for downlink multi-antenna systems that contains SDMA and NOMA as special cases. RSMA relies on linearly precoded rate-splitting with SIC to decode part of the interference and treat the remaining part of the interference as noise. This capability of RSMA to partially decode interference and partially treat interference as noise enables to softly bridge the two extremes of fully decoding interference and treating interference as noise and provides room for rate and QoS enhancements and complexity reduction. The three multiple access schemes are compared, and extensive numerical results show that RSMA provides a smooth transition between SDMA and NOMA and outperforms them both in a wide range of network loads (underloaded and overloaded regimes) and user deployments (with a diversity of channel directions, channel strengths, and qualities of channel state information at the transmitter). Moreover, RSMA provides rate and QoS enhancements over NOMA at a lower computational complexity for the transmit scheduler and the receivers (number of SIC layers).},

abstract = {We study RF-enabled wireless energy transfer (WET) via energy beamforming, from a multi-antenna energy transmitter (ET) to multiple energy receivers (ERs) in a backscatter communication system such as RFID. The acquisition of the forward-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER) state information (F-CSI) at the ET (or RFID reader) is challenging, since the ERs (or RFID tags) are typically too energy-and-hardware-constrained to estimate or feedback the F-CSI. The ET leverages its observed backscatter signals to estimate the backscatter-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER-to-ET) state information (BS-CSI) directly. We first analyze the harvested energy obtained using the estimated BS-CSI. Furthermore, we optimize the resource allocation to maximize the total utility of harvested energy. For WET to single ER, we obtain the optimal channel-training energy in a semiclosed form. For WET to multiple ERs, we optimize the channel-training energy and the energy allocation weights for different energy beams. For the straightforward weighted-sum-energy (WSE) maximization, the optimal WET scheme is shown to use only one energy beam, which leads to unfairness among ERs and motivates us to consider the complicated proportional-fair-energy (PFE) maximization. For PFE maximization, we show that it is a biconvex problem, and propose a block-coordinate-descent-based algorithm to find the close-to-optimal solution. Numerical results show that with the optimized solutions, the harvested energy suffers slight reduction of less than 10%, compared to that obtained using the perfect F-CSI.},

We provide performance analysis of the proposed detection strategies in terms of the (asymptotic) signal-to-(interference plus noise) ratio and the bit error rate, and we show that AAF achieves a full second-order diversity when a minimum mean-square-error detector is employed at both the relay side and the BS.

abstract = {We consider a monostatic wireless powered backscatter communication (WPBC) system, where a device performs backscatter modulation and energy harvesting (EH) using the received signal from a multi-antenna hybrid access point. The rate-energy regions of the WPBC are studied for power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) receivers in a comprehensive way by using the rate and EH functions reflecting the effects of practical systems. For both linear and nonlinear EH models, we analyze the rate-energy regions of the static PS and TS strategies and optimize the dynamic strategies exploiting the channel state information (CSI) to extend the regions. The regions with the static strategies are obtained in closed-form expressions and the dynamic strategies are obtained in explicit forms as a function of a dual variable, by approximating the nonlinear EH model to a piecewise linear EH (PLEH) model. The results show that the dynamic PS and TS strategies outperform their static counterparts and their gains are more prominent in the sensitivity region of a nonlinear EH circuit and with a smaller number of antennas. It is also observed that the dynamic PS strategy provides the best performance but can be replaced by the static one for a large number of antennas to avoid the CSI. The strategies obtained explicitly by using the PLEH model are also shown to work well with a practical EH model without a noticeable loss in the performance.},

abstract = {In this paper, a downlink single-cell non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network with uniformly deployed users is considered and an analytical framework to evaluate its performance is developed. Particularly, the performance of NOMA is studied by assuming two types of partial channel state information (CSI). For the first one, which is based on imperfect CSI, we present a simple closed-form approximation for the outage probability and the average sum rate, as well as their high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) expressions. For the second type of CSI, which is based on second order statistics (SOS), we derive a closed-form expression for the outage probability and an approximate expression for the average sum rate for the special case two users. For the addressed scenario with the two types of partial CSI, the results demonstrate that NOMA can achieve superior performance compared to the traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA). Moreover, SOS-based NOMA always achieves better performance than that with imperfect CSI, while it can achieve similar performance to the NOMA with perfect CSI at the low SNR region. The provided numerical results confirm that the derived expressions for the outage probability and the average sum rate match well with the Monte Carlo simulations.},

abstract = {In a superimposed unicast and multicast transmission system, one layer of Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) is required at each receiver to remove the multicast stream before decoding the unicast stream. In this paper, we show that a linearly-precoded Rate-Splitting (RS) strategy at the transmitter can efficiently exploit this existing SIC receiver architecture. By splitting the unicast message into common and private parts and encoding the common parts along with the multicast message into a super-common stream decoded by all users, the SIC is used for the dual purpose of separating the unicast and multicast streams as well as better managing the multi-user interference between the unicast streams. The precoders are designed with the objective of maximizing the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) of the unicast messages subject to a Quality of Service (QoS) requirement of the multicast message and a sum power constraint. Numerical results show that RS outperforms existing Multi-User Linear-Precoding (MU-LP) and power-domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) in a wide range of user deployments (with a diversity of channel directions and channel strengths). Moreover, since one layer of SIC is required to separate the unicast and multicast streams, the performance gain of RS comes without any increase in the receiver complexity compared with MU-LP. Hence, in such non-orthogonal unicast and multicast transmissions, RS provides rate and QoS enhancements at no extra cost for the receivers.},

abstract = {This paper considers orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer. We study the resource allocation algorithm design for maximization of the energy efficiency of data transmission (bits/Joule delivered to the receivers). In particular, we focus on power splitting hybrid receivers which are able to split the received signals into two power streams for concurrent information decoding and energy harvesting. Two scenarios are investigated considering different power splitting abilities of the receivers. In the first scenario, we assume receivers which can split the received power into a continuous set of power streams with arbitrary power splitting ratios. In the second scenario, we examine receivers which can split the received power only into a discrete set of power streams with fixed power splitting ratios. For both scenarios, we formulate the corresponding algorithm design as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account the circuit power consumption, the minimum data rate requirements of delay constrained services, the minimum required system data rate, and the minimum amount of power that has to be delivered to the receivers. By exploiting fractional programming and dual decomposition, suboptimal iterative resource allocation algorithms are developed to solve the non-convex problems. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithms approach the optimal solution within a small number of iterations and unveil the trade-off between energy efficiency, system capacity, and wireless power transfer: (1) wireless power transfer enhances the system energy efficiency by harvesting energy in the radio frequency, especially in the interference limited regime; (2) the presence of multiple receivers is beneficial for the system capacity, but not necessarily for the system energy efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2002-2012 IEEE.},

In contrast, this work derives information-theoretic limits, and demonstrates that the capacity is achieved by a scheme that jointly encodes information in the transmitted signal as well as in the RIS configuration. In addition, a novel signaling strategy based on layered encoding is proposed that enables practical successive cancellation-type decoding at the receiver. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the standard max-SNR scheme that fixes the configuration of the RIS as to maximize the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the receiver is strictly suboptimal, and is outperformed by the proposed strategies at all practical SNR levels.},

abstract = {This paper presents a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) concept for cellular future radio access (FRA) towards the 2020s information society. Different from the current LTE radio access scheme (until Release 11), NOMA superposes multiple users in the power domain although its basic signal waveform could be based on the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) or the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-spread OFDM the same as LTE baseline. In our concept, NOMA adopts a successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver as the baseline receiver scheme for robust multiple access, considering the expected evolution of device processing capabilities in the future. Based on system-level evaluations, we show that the downlink NOMA with SIC improves both the capacity and cell-edge user throughput performance irrespective of the availability of the frequency-selective channel quality indicator (CQI) on the base station side. Furthermore, we discuss possible extensions of NOMA by jointly applying multi-antenna/site technologies with a proposed NOMA/MIMO scheme using SIC and an interference rejection combining (IRC) receiver to achieve further capacity gains, e.g., a three-fold gain in the spectrum efficiency representing a challenging target for FRA. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the optimal design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in downlink multiuser orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, where the users harvest energy and decode information using the same signals received from a fixed access point (AP). For information transmission, we consider two types of multiple access schemes, namely, time division multiple access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). At the receiver side, due to the practical limitation that circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly, each user applies either time switching (TS) or power splitting (PS) to coordinate the energy harvesting (EH) and information decoding (ID) processes. For the TDMA-based information transmission, we employ TS at the receivers; for the OFDMA-based information transmission, we employ PS at the receivers. Under the above two scenarios, we address the problem of maximizing the weighted sum-rate over all users by varying the time/frequency power allocation and either TS or PS ratio, subject to a minimum harvested energy constraint on each user as well as a peak and/or total transmission power constraint. For the TS scheme, by an appropriate variable transformation the problem is reformulated as a convex problem, for which the optimal power allocation and TS ratio are obtained by the Lagrange duality method. For the PS scheme, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the power allocation, subcarrier (SC) allocation and the PS ratio for each user. The performances of the two schemes are compared numerically as well as analytically for the special case of single-user setup. It is revealed that the peak power constraint imposed on each OFDM SC as well as the number of users in the system play key roles in the rate-energy performance comparison by the two proposed schemes. {\textcopyright} 2002-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesting is a promising technology that obtains energy from electromagnetic waves. As an alternative energy source, this modern technology can provide power wirelessly enabling the practical use of battery-free devices and it is also expected to be widely used in future applications. Many studies have examined the effects of different modulation techniques on power or efficiency in RF energy-harvesting systems. In this article, the effects of different modulation techniques, such as amplitude shift keying (ASK), quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), phase-shift keying (PSK), and frequency shift keying (FSK) on charging time, were measured and theoretically analyzed in detail. The measurement system was designed using a signal generator, an RF energy-harvesting circuit, and other auxiliary devices. The signal generator produced four different modulated signals as transmit power signals from 1 to 10 dBm at the interval of 1 dBm, and then, the RF energy-harvesting circuit was fed with these power signals. According to the measurement results, four different modulation techniques charged the RF energy-harvesting circuit at different times. It was observed that the 4-ASK modulation technique had the shortest charging time in the range of 1-10 dBm when comparing to QAM, PSK, and FSK modulation techniques, and thus, it was evaluated to be the most suitable modulation technique for the RF energy-harvesting system among these modulation techniques in terms of charging time.},

abstract = {The eigenproblem for an n-by-n matrix A is the problem of the approximation (within a relative error bound 2-b) of all the eigenvalues of the matrix A and computing the associated eigenspaces of all these eigenvalues. We show that the arithmetic complexity of this problem is bounded by O(n3+(n log2 n) log b). If the characteristic and minimum polynomials of the matrix A coincide with each other (which is the case for genetic matrices of all classes of general and special matrices that we consider), then the latter deterministic cost bound can be replaced by the randomized bound O(KA(2n)+n2+(n log2 n) log b) where KA(2n) denotes the cost of the computation of the 2n-1 vectors Aiv, i = 1,...,2n-1, maximized over all n-dimensional vectors v; KA(2n) = O(M(n) log n), for M(n) = o(n2.376) denoting the arithmetic complexity of n×n matrix multiplication. This bound on the complexity of the eigenproblem is optimal up to a logarithmic factor and implies much faster solution of the eigenproblem for the important special classes of matrices. In particular, we prove the bound O(n2 log n+(n log2 n) log b) on the randomized arithmetic complexity of the eigenproblem for generic matrices of the classes of n×n Toeplitz, Hankel, Toeplitz-like, Hankel-like and Toeplitz-like-plus-Hankel-like matrices. Then again, this bound is optimal (up to a logarithmic factor) for each of the latter classes of input matrices. We also prove similar nearly optimal upper bounds for the generic Cauchy-like, Vandermonde-like and sparse matrices. All our complexity estimates for the eigenproblem improve the known ones by order of magnitude.},

abstract = {The capacity of noncoherent time-selective Rayleigh-fading channels is studied under various models for the variations in time. The study includes both single-input and single-output (SISO) and multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. A block-fading model is first considered where the channel changes correlatively over each block period of length T, and independently across blocks. The predictability of the channel is characterized through the rank Q of the correlation matrix of the vector of channel gains in each block. This model includes, as special cases, the standard block-fading model where the channel remains constant over block periods (Q = 1), and models where the fading process has finite differential entropy rate (Q = T). The capacity is initially studied for long block lengths and some straightforward but interesting asymptotes are established. For the case where Q is kept fixed as T → ∞, it is shown that the non-coherent capacity converges to the coherent capacity. For the case where both T, Q → ∞, with Q/T being held constant, a bound on the capacity loss due to channel unpredictability is established. The more interesting scenario of large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is then explored in detail. For SISO systems, useful upper and lower bounds on the large SNR asymptotic capacity are derived, and it is shown that the capacity grows logarithmically with SNR with a slope of T/T-Q, for Q < T. Next, in order to facilitate the analysis of MIMO systems, the rank-Q block-fading model is specialized to the case where each T-symbol block consists of Q subblocks of length L, with the channel remaining constant over each subblock and changing correlatively across subblocks. For this model, it is shown that the log SNR growth behavior of the capacity is the same as that of the standard block-fading model with block length L. Finally, the SISO and MIMO channel models are generalized to allow the fading process to be correlated across blocks in a stationary and ergodic manner. It is shown that the log SNR growth behavior of the capacity is not affected by the correlation across blocks. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

These systems utilize the radio resources and infrastructure of the active radio systems to perform their functionalities. By enabling the dependent coexistence, a new technology named symbiotic radio (SRad) enables the symbiotic relationships between the different radio systems ranging from mutual benefits or competition in terms of sharing the resources, in particular for IoT devices. This survey first provides the motivation for dependent coexistence and background of spectrum sharing through coexistence along with existing literature. Then, it describes the active and passive radio systems definition and a brief overview. Afterward, the history of symbiosis and the role of SRad technology in spectrum sharing and coexistence are defined while focusing on symbiotic communication.

The second detector first estimates the channel based on the observed signal and then performs the hypothesis test. Test statistics and the optimal decision threshold of the detectors are derived. The energy detector is shown to be an approximation of the second detector. For cases where the reader is able to avoid or cancel the direct interference from the RF source (e.g., through successive interference cancellation), a third detector is given as a special case of the first detector.

In particular, RIS-assisted wireless communications have the great potential to achieve significant performance improvement and coverage enhancement in a cost-effective and energy-efficient manner, by properly programming the reflection coefficients of the unit cells of RISs. In this paper, the free-space path loss models of RIS-assisted wireless communications are developed for different scenarios by studying the physics and electromagnetic nature of RISs. The proposed models, which are first validated through extensive simulation results, reveal the relationships between the free-space path loss of RIS-assisted wireless communications and the distances from the transmitter/receiver to the RIS, the size of the RIS, the near-field/far-field effects of the RIS, and the radiation patterns of antennas and unit cells. In addition, three fabricated RISs (metasurfaces) are utilized to further corroborate theoretical findings through experimental measurements conducted in a microwave anechoic chamber. The measurement results match well with the modeling results, thus validating the proposed free-space path loss models for RIS, which may pave the way for further theoretical studies and practical applications in this field.},

In order to guarantee the throughput requirements, we aim to maximize the minimum user rate among all the tags by jointly optimizing the backscatter time allocation and power reflection coefficient. Channel state information (CSI) mismatch is taken into account in our proposed optimization problem, which leads to a robust chance-constrained optimization problem. To deal with the nonconvex chance constraints, we propose two safe approximation methods: 1) Bernstein-type-inequality and 2) conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), applying to the Gaussian distribution and arbitrary distribution of channel estimation errors, respectively. In addition, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal value of minimum throughput. Finally, simulation results reveal that the CVaR-based method outperforms the Bernstein-type-inequality-based method for the non-Gaussian channel estimation error.},

The proposed scheme takes advantage of the available excess degrees of freedom at the base station to enhance the ergodic achievable rate. The ergodic achievable rate region of the proposed scheme is characterized using finite-size random matrix theory (RMT). Our results illustrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms traditional MIMO-OMA and zero forcing based MIMO-NOMA schemes, and has a small performance gap to the achievable rate region of MIMO-NOMA.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation problem for the symbiotic radio system, in which the passive backscatter transmission is parasitic in the primary transmission, and the cooperative receiver simultaneously detects the signals transmitted from the active primary transmitter (PT) and the backscatter device (BD). In particular, channel fading is considered, and the ergodic weighted sum rate of the primary and backscatter transmissions is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit power at the PT and the reflection coefficient at the BD under either long-term or short-term transmit-power constraint over the fading states. Two practical transmission setups are considered, where the relationship between the primary and backscatter transmissions is either commensal or parasitic. For the commensal setup, we fix the reflection coefficient as the maximum value and derive the optimal power allocation scheme based on the standard convex optimization procedure. For the parasitic setup, the weighted sum-rate maximization problem is non-convex, and we resort to the concave-convex procedure to derive a suboptimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that in the commensal setup, the BD may realize transmission while causing no harmful interference to the primary system; in the parasitic setup, a higher backscatter data rate can be achieved through slightly sacrificing the primary transmission rate.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a cost-effective solution for achieving high spectrum and energy efficiency in future wireless networks by leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect the signals with adjustable phase shifts. Prior works on IRS mainly consider continuous phase shifts at reflecting elements, which are practically difficult to implement due to the hardware limitation. In contrast, we study in this paper an IRS-Aided wireless network, where an IRS with only a finite number of phase shifts at each element is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-Antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-Antenna users. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the continuous transmit precoding at the AP and the discrete reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a given set of minimum signal-To-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the user receivers. The considered problem is shown to be a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) and thus is difficult to solve in general. To tackle this problem, we first study the single-user case with one user assisted by the IRS and propose both optimal and suboptimal algorithms for solving it. Besides, we analytically show that as compared to the ideal case with continuous phase shifts, the IRS with discrete phase shifts achieves the same squared power gain in terms of asymptotically large number of reflecting elements, while a constant proportional power loss is incurred that depends only on the number of phase-shift levels. The proposed designs for the single-user case are also extended to the general setup with multiple users among which some are aided by the IRS. Simulation results verify our performance analysis as well as the effectiveness of our proposed designs as compared to various benchmark schemes.},

In this letter, we propose and analyse a Cooperative Rate-Splitting (CRS) strategy based on the three-node relay channel where the transmitter is equipped with multiple antennas. By splitting user messages and linearly precoding common and private streams at the transmitter, and opportunistically asking the relaying user to forward its decoded common message, CRS can efficiently cope with a wide range of propagation conditions (disparity of user channel strengths and directions) and compensate for the performance degradation due to deep fading. The precoder design and the resource allocation are optimized by solving the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) maximization problem. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed CRS scheme can achieve an explicit rate region improvement compared to its non-cooperative counterpart and other cooperative strategies (such as cooperative NOMA).},

We aim to maximize the weighted sum-power transferred to all EH receivers subject to given minimum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at different ID receivers. In particular, we consider two types of ID receivers (referred to as Type I and Type II, respectively) without or with the capability of cancelling the interference from (a priori known) energy signals. For each type of ID receivers, we formulate the joint information and energy transmit beamforming design as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). First, we obtain the globally optimal solutions for our formulated QCQPs by applying an optimization technique so-called semidefinite relaxation (SDR). It is shown via SDR that under the condition of independently distributed user channels, no dedicated energy beam is used for the case of Type I ID receivers to achieve the optimal solution; while for the case of Type II ID receivers, employing no more than one energy beam is optimal. Next, we establish a new form of the celebrated uplink-downlink duality for our studied downlink beamforming problems, and thereby develop alternative algorithms to obtain the same optimal solutions as by SDR. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of proposed optimal beamforming designs for MISO SWIPT systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {The maximum-likelihood (ML) multiuser detector is well known to exhibit better bit-error-rate (BER) performance than many other multiuser detectors. Unfortunately, ML detection (MLD) is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem, for which there is no known algorithm that can find the optimal solution with polynomial-time complexity (in the number of users). In this paper, a polynomial-time approximation method called semi-definite (SD) relaxation is applied to the MLD problem with antipodal data transmission. SD relaxation is an accurate approximation method for certain NP-hard problems. The SD relaxation ML (SDR-ML) detector is efficient in that its complexity is of the order of K 3.5, where K is the number of users. We illustrate the potential of the SDR-ML detector by showing that some existing detectors, such as the decorrelator and the linear-minimum-mean-square-error detector, can be interpreted as degenerate forms of the SDR-ML detector. Simulation results indicate that the BER performance of the SDR-ML detector is better than that of these existing detectors and is close to that of the true ML detector, even when the cross-correlations between users are strong or the near-far effect is significant.},

abstract = {This paper studies the coordinated beamforming design problem for the multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel, assuming only channel distribution information (CDI) known to the transmitters. Under a given requirement on the rate outage probability for receivers, we aim to maximize the system utility (e.g., the weighted sum rate, weighted geometric mean rate, and the weighed harmonic mean rate) subject to the rate outage constraints and individual power constraints. The outage constraints, however, lead to a complicated, nonconvex structure for the considered beamforming design problem and render the optimization problem difficult to handle. Although this nonconvex optimization problem can be solved in an exhaustive search manner, this brute-force approach is only feasible when the number of transmitter-receiver pairs is small. For a system with a large number of transmitter-receiver pairs, computationally efficient alternatives are necessary. Hence, the focus of this paper is the design of such efficient approximation methods. In particular, by employing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and first-order approximation techniques, we propose an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that provides high-quality approximate beamforming solutions via solving a sequence of convex approximation problems. The solution thus obtained is further shown to be a stationary point for the SDR of the original outage constrained beamforming design problem. Furthermore, we propose a distributed SCA algorithm where each transmitter optimizes its own beamformer using local CDI and information obtained from limited message exchange with the other transmitters. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCA algorithm and its distributed counterpart indeed converge, and promising performance can be achieved for all the considered system utilities. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Based on the time switching (TS) and power splitting (PS) receiver architectures, two operating schemes are employed to enable energy harvesting and ambient backscattering at the ambient backscatter (AB) transmitter. In order to maximize the outage capacity for the AB transmitters, we formulate two optimization problems optimizing the TS and PS ratios. Two schemes with low complexity are proposed to obtain the near-optimal outage performance. Considering the coexistence of the AmBackComs and cellular downlink transmissions, successful transmission probabilities for AB transmitters and cellular downlink transmissions are both derived for the TS and PS schemes and provide insights on how various system parameters, such as the TS ratio, the PS ratio, the density of base stations (BSs)/AB transmitters, etc., impact the system performance. Numerical results show that the outage capacity for AmBackComs can be significantly improved by selecting a proper TS/PS ratio and our proposed schemes can achieve near-optimal outage capacities. The study also shows that many more ultra-low-power devices users can be connected via the proposed scheme at a cost of a slightly reduced overall network capacity.},

Spectrum sensing helps in the detection of spectrum holes (unused channels of the band), and instantly move into vacant channels while avoiding occupied ones. An energy detector with baseband sampling for CR is presented with mathematical analyses for an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. A brief overview of the energy detection based spectrum sensing for CR technology is introduced. Practical implementation issues on Texas Instruments TMS320C6713 floating point DSP board are presented. Novelties of this work came from a derivation of probability of detection and probability of false alarm for the baseband energy detector without including the sampling theorems and the associated approximation.},

abstract = {According to the limited communication distance and the low transmission efficiency for massive electronic tags/sensors of traditional or bistatic backscatter technology, the BackFi transmission protocol design with energy harvesting of massive smart multi-hop electronic tags/sensors was investigated in the ambient backscatter communication systems. This paper proposed the large-scale tags/sensors multi-hop communication protocols with energy harvesting under Wi-Fi architecture, where the 'CTS-to-self' frame can be used to set the traditional AP/STA to the sensing status without sending, and then, the new defined frame 'Multi-RTS' may send the trigger signal to massive tags or sensors with its frame field as 'M-RTS' strategy, compressed bitmap, tags/sensors number, and other messages. The tags/sensors shall respond to the sounding signal and give the backscatter signal to AP using energy harvesting. It can be mentioned that the Wi-Fi standard in this paper is based on the IEEE 802.11ah. Finally, AP can collect and modulate the backscatter signal after massive tags/sensors response to the reader. It was worth noting that the multi-hop relay adopts the power splitting way to implement the communication process, where the object function was energy efficiency maximization with the parameters optimization of transmitting power and relay scaling factor. In order to solve the non-convex problem, this paper derived the approximate expression in the high SNR case and achieved the optimal solution via the Lambert W function. The simulation and analysis verified the effectiveness of the proposed schemes and the correctness of the derivations.},

abstract = {Consider a downlink communication system where multiantenna base stations transmit independent data streams to decentralized single-antenna users over a common frequency band. The goal of the base stations is to jointly adjust the beamforming vectors to minimize the transmission powers while ensuring the signal-to-interference-noise ratio requirement of each user within the system. At the same time, it may be necessary to keep the interference generated on other coexisting systems under a certain tolerable level. In addition, one may want to include general individual shaping constraints on the beamforming vectors. This beamforming problem is a separable homogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic program, and it is difficult to solve in general. In this paper, we give conditions under which strong duality holds and propose efficient algorithms for the optimal beamforming problem. First, we study rank-constrained solutions of general separable semidefinite programs (SDPs) and propose rank reduction procedures to achieve a lower rank solution. Then we show that the SDP relaxation of three classes of optimal beamforming problem always has a rank-one solution, which can be obtained by invoking the rank reduction procedures.

The key issue of ambient backscatter communication systems is how to perform reliable detection. In this paper, we propose novel encoding methods at the information tag and devise the corresponding symbol detection methods at the reader. In particular, Manchester coding and differential Manchester coding are adopted at the information tag, and the corresponding semi-coherent Manchester (SeCoMC) and non-coherent Manchester (NoCoMC) detectors are developed. In addition, analytical bit-error-rate (BER) expressions are characterized for both detectors assuming either complex Gaussian or unknown deterministic ambient signal. Simulation results show that the BER performance of unknown deterministic ambient signal is better, and the SeCoMC detector outperforms the NoCoMC detector. Finally, compared with the prior detectors for ambient backscatter communications, the proposed detectors have the advantages of achieving superior BER performance with lower communication delay.},

To minimize the mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation, we first formulate an optimization problem for designing the IRS reflection pattern in the training phase under the constraints of unit-modulus, discrete phase, and full rank. This problem, however, is NP-hard and thus difficult to solve in general. As such, we propose a low-complexity yet efficient method to solve it sub-optimally, by constructing a near-orthogonal reflection pattern based on either discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-matrix quantization or Hadamard-matrix truncation. Based on the estimated channel, we then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable rate by designing the discrete-phase passive beamforming at the IRS with the training overhead and channel estimation error taken into account. To reduce the computational complexity of exhaustive search, we further propose a low-complexity successive refinement algorithm with a properly-designed initialization to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution.

Contrary to existing works, we consider a rather unorthodox transmission scheme. In particular, the message intended to one of the users is split into two parts: a common part which can be recovered by all users, and a private part recovered by the corresponding user. On the other hand, the rest of users receive their information through private messages. This rate-splitting (RS) approach was shown to boost the achievable degrees of freedom when CSIT errors decay with increased SNR. In this paper, the RS strategy is married with linear precoder design and optimization techniques to achieve a maximized ergodic SR (ESR) performance over the entire range of SNRs. Precoders are designed based on partial CSIT knowledge by solving a stochastic rate optimization problem using means of sample average approximation coupled with the weighted minimum mean square error approach. Numerical results show that in addition to the ESR gains, the benefits of RS also include relaxed CSIT quality requirements and enhanced achievable rate regions compared with conventional transmission with no rate-splitting.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is envisioned to have abundant applications in future wireless networks by smartly reconfiguring the signal propagation for performance enhancement. Specifically, an IRS consists of a large number of low-cost passive elements each reflecting the incident signal with a certain phase shift to collaboratively achieve beamforming and suppress interference at one or more designated receivers. In this paper, we study an IRS-enhanced point-to-point multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless system where one IRS is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to a single-antenna user. As a result, the user simultaneously receives the signal sent directly from the AP as well as that reflected by the IRS. We aim to maximize the total received signal power at the user by jointly optimizing the (active) transmit beamforming at the AP and (passive) reflect beamforming by the phase shifters at the IRS. We first propose a centralized algorithm based on the technique of semidefinite relaxation (SDR) by assuming the global channel state information (CSI) available at the IRS. Since the centralized implementation requires excessive channel estimation and signal exchange overheads, we further propose a low-complexity distributed algorithm where the AP and IRS independently adjust the transmit beamforming and the phase shifts in an alternating manner until the convergence is reached. Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be achieved by the proposed algorithms as compared to benchmark schemes. Moreover, it is verified that the IRS is able to drastically enhance the link quality and/or coverage over the conventional setup without the IRS.},

In this paper, we consider a backscatter communication network wirelessly powered by a power beacon station (PBS). Each backscatter radio uses the harvested energy to power its data transmissions, in which some other radios can help as the wireless relays with an aim to improve throughput performance by cooperative transmission. Under this setting, we formulate a throughput maximization problem to jointly optimize WPT and the relay strategy of the backscatter radios. An iterative algorithm with reduced complexity and communication overhead is proposed to decompose the original problem into two sub-problems distributed at the PBS and the backscatter receiver. Moreover, we take uncertain channel information into consideration and formulate robust counter-parts of the throughput maximization problem when either the backscatter or relay channel is subject to estimation errors. The difficulty of the robust counter-part lies in the coupling of the PBS' power allocation and relay strategy in matrix inequalities, which is addressed by alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence. Numerical results reveal that the cooperative relay strategy of the backscatter radios significantly improves the throughput performance.},

abstract = {Backscatter communications have two major antenna configurations: the bistatic configuration, in which the reader employs two different sets of antennas to transmit and receive, and the monostatic configuration, in which the reader employs one set of antennas for both transmitting and receiving. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study on the MIMO techniques for the $M \times L$ monostatic channel. Particularly we study on the joint design of the query and the coding matrices. We show that the maximum achievable diversity order of the monostatic channel is the diversity order achieved by the block-lever unitary query and orthogonal space-time block code (BUTQ-OSTBC) design pair, which is $\frac {ML}{2}$ , exactly the half of the diversity order of the conventional MIMO channel. Then we show that uniform query, the simplest query approach, cannot achieve the maximum achievable diversity order in the monostatic channel. We generalize BUTQ-OSTBC to the general augmenting approach, and show that unitary matrix is optimal in terms of SER performance among all possible query matrices, when OSTBC is employed. The above results further indicate that in the backscatter channel, additional diversity can be obtained by varying the query signals over time slots within the channel coherent time, which is quite different from the results from the conventional MIMO channels. We verify our results by Monte Carlo simulations.},

abstract = {Terahertz (THz) band provides huge bandwidth but the molecular absorptions in these frequencies cause high path losses in long-distance communications. Recently, multi-band ultra-massive MIMO (UM-MIMO) systems based on graphene-based plasmonic nano-antennas have been proposed to overcome the distance problem. In the UM MIMO systems, the mutual coupling effect is a challenging problem because of the ultra-dense integration of the multi-band nano-antenna arrays. In this paper, a graphene-based frequency selective surface (FSS) is proposed to reduce the coupling effects in dense plasmonic nano-antenna arrays for multi-band UM MIMO systems. The performance of the proposed structure is evaluated by full-wave simulation for different cases. The results show that the FSS structure has a wide stopband (-15 dB bandwidth, approximately 43%-50%) from 1.1 to 1.7 THz. By inserting the FSS structure between nano-antennas, a high isolation coefficient of -25 dB with a 15 dB fall and an envelope correlation coefficient of less than 0.01 are achieved. The field distributions and the radiation patterns are also presented to confirm that the proposed FSS structure improves the performance of the array with negligible influence on the antenna itself. Moreover, the receiving mode simulation of the array is performed with the FSS structure. It is also asymptotically shown that the mutual coupling experienced by the nano-antenna with the FSS structure is negligible even in the presence of a very large number of closely integrated elements. Finally, the technological issues are discussed for practical implementations.},

abstract = {Backscatter communication (BSC) technology can enable ubiquitous deployment of low-cost sustainable wireless devices. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of a full-duplex multiple-input-multiple-output reader for enhancing the limited communication range of monostatic BSC systems. As this performance is strongly influenced by the channel estimation (CE) quality, we first derive a novel least-squares estimator for the forward and backward links between the reader and the tag, assuming that reciprocity holds and K orthogonal pilots are transmitted from the first K antennas of an N antenna reader. We also obtain the corresponding linear minimum-mean square-error estimate for the backscattered channel. After defining the transceiver design at the reader using these estimates, we jointly optimize the number of orthogonal pilots and energy allocation for the CE and information decoding phases to maximize the average backscattered signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for efficiently decoding the tag's messages. The unimodality of this SNR in optimization variables along with a tight analytical approximation for the jointly global optimal design is also discoursed. Lastly, the selected numerical results validate the proposed analysis, present key insights into the optimal resource utilization at reader, and quantify the achievable gains over the benchmark schemes.},

abstract = {Backscattering communications have been recently proposed as an effective enabling technology for massive Internet of Things (IoT) development. A novel application of backscattering, called ambient backscattering (AmBC), has been gaining much attention, wherein backscattering communications exploit existing RF signals without the need for a dedicated transmitter. In such a system, data demodulation process is strongly complicated by the random nature of the illuminating signal, as well as by the presence of the direct-link interference (DLI) from the legacy system. To overcome these shortcomings, one can resort to noncoherent detection strategies, aimed at reducing or even nullifying the amount of a priori information needed to reliably perform signal demodulation. In this paper, we investigate noncoherent detection strategies for backscatter communications over ambient OFDM signals and solve the noncoherent maximumlikelihood (ML) detection problem for a general Q-ary signal constellation. Additionally, we derive a suboptimal detector, which takes the form of the classical energy-detector (ED), whose performance is evaluated in closed-form. Finally, the performance of the proposed detectors is corroborated through Monte Carlo simulations.},

We characterize the bit error rate (BER) of a multiantenna (MA) receiver by deriving the expression for antenna gain achievable after the direct link (DL) cancellation.

AmBC systems enable communications between RF-powered devices (e.g., tags and sensors) and AmBC receivers by utilizing ambient RF source signals from existing communication systems. Thus it offers a low-cost and energy-efficient means of communications for future IoT applications. In the current AmBC research, the impact of using channel coding on existing primary networks in terms of the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the AmBC systems are mostly ignored. Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that offer fast encoding and decoding process have been proposed as promising channel codes in the fifth-generation (5 G) networks. In this paper, we investigate the BER performance of an AmBC system that uses LDPC-coded RF source signals. We have analytically derived the BER upper and lower bounds of both the RF source and tag signals for our proposed AmBC system. Simulation results show that the BERs of both signals decrease significantly, compared to conventional AmBC systems with uncoded RF source signals.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate resource allocation algorithm design for large intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. To this end, we adopt a physics-based IRS model that, unlike the conventional IRS model, takes into account the impact of the incident and reflection angles of the impinging electromagnetic wave on the reflected signal. To facilitate efficient resource allocation design for large IRSs, we employ a scalable optimization framework, where the IRS is partitioned into several tiles and the phase shift elements of each tile are jointly designed to realize different transmission modes. Then, the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the transmission mode selection of the tiles of the IRS are jointly optimized for minimization of the BS transmit power taking into account the quality-of-service requirements of both non-linear energy harvesting receivers and information decoding receivers. For handling the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we apply a penalty-based method, successive convex approximation, and semidefinite relaxation to develop a computationally efficient algorithm which asymptotically converges to a locally optimal solution of the considered problem. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme enables considerable power savings compared to two baseline schemes. Moreover, our results also illustrate that the advocated physics-based model and scalable optimization framework for large IRSs allows us to strike a balance between system performance and computational complexity, which is vital for realizing large IRS-assisted communication systems.},

Such models are typical in communication systems, where the covariance matrix of the channel vector depends on random parameters, e.g., angles of propagation paths. If the covariance matrices exhibit certain Toeplitz and shift-invariance structures, the complexity of the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimator can be reduced to O(M\log M) floating point operations, where M is the channel dimension. While in the absence of structure the complexity is much higher, we obtain a similarly efficient (but suboptimal) estimator by using the MMSE estimator of the structured model as a blueprint for the architecture of a neural network. This network learns the MMSE estimator for the unstructured model, but only within the given class of estimators that contains the MMSE estimator for the structured model. Numerical simulations with typical spatial channel models demonstrate the generalization properties of the chosen class of estimators to realistic channel models.},

abstract = {Proper operation of active circuits in a wirelessly powered system requires both sufficient power flow and voltage. Passive (battery-less) wireless systems, operating in the high-frequency band, pose a challenge: generating sufficient amount of supply voltage from very low-input-power flow. The answer to this problem involves implementation of a new class of power-sipping, voltage multiplying power management blocks, which have a wide variety of applications from implantable microelectronic devices (IMD) to internet of things (IoT) and radio-frequency identification (RFID). This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey on the rectification and voltage multiplication of low-input power signals in the frequency range of 100 MH z-1 GH z in remotelypowered systems which require up to several hundred ?A current and operate with less than 3 V supply voltage. The survey covers topologies of voltage multipliers, novel devices, and efficiency/voltage boosting techniques. Since existing voltage multipliers are designed with various process technologies, a comparison among available devices in various topologies is difficult. For a fair comparison between specifications of several state-of-the-art topologies, we have migrated and simulated some of them in one exemplar process technology under the same set of constraints. We observe that the voltage multiplier with cross-coupled configuration yields the best power conversion efficiency at an optimized input voltage; however, it drops immediately after this voltage is reached. We also found that the voltage multiplier with Schottky diodes, used in the Dickson topology, exhibits the lowest sensitivity. When input voltage increases to a level of more than 1 V, the Dickson voltage multiplier with ultra-low-power diodes maintains the highest efficiency, reaching around 80% in the wide input voltage range. To gain a perspective of practical implementation, we also explore various design issues.},

Initial work on ambient backscatter shows promising results but has focused on narrow band operation in well controlled laboratory settings. The goal of this work is to enable the ubiquitous deployment of ultra-low power nodes that communicate via ambient backscatter to wired Universal Backscatter Readers, in real-world environments. This is accomplished through ultra-wideband backscatter techniques that leverage the breath of commercial broadcast signals in the 80 MHz to 900 MHz range from FM radios, digital TVs, and cellular networks. Additionally the use of powered Universal Backscatter Readers allows a network of ultra-low power nodes to operate on ambient carriers as low as -80 dBm, which is typical for indoor home and office environments.

abstract = {This paper considers the forward error correction (FEC) code design for approaching the capacity of a dynamic multiple access channel (MAC) where both the number of users and their respective signal powers keep constantly changing, resembling the scenario of an actual wireless cellular system. To obtain a low-complexity non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme, we propose a serial concatenation of a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code and a repetition code (REP), this way achieving near Gaussian MAC (GMAC) capacity performance while coping with the dynamics of the MAC system. The joint optimization of the LDPC and REP codes is addressed by matching the analytical extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) functions of the sub-optimal multi-user detector (MUD) and the channel code for a specific and static MAC system, achieving near-GMAC capacity. We show that the near-capacity performance can be flexibly maintained with the same LDPC code regardless of the variations in the number of users and power levels. This flexibility (or elasticity) is provided by the REP code, acting as “user-load and power equalizer”, dramatically simplifying the practical implementation of NOMA schemes, as only a single LDPC code is needed to cope with the dynamics of the MAC system.},

abstract = {The millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band has been utilized in the IEEE 802.11ad standard to achieve multi-Gbps throughput. Despite the advantages, mmWave links are highly vulnerable to both user and environmental mobility. Since mmWave radios use highly directional antennas, the line-of-sight (LOS) signal can be easily blocked by various obstacles, such as walls, furniture, and humans. In the complicated indoor environment, it is highly possible that the blocked mmWave link cannot be restored no matter how the access point and the mobile user change their antenna directions. To address the problem and enable indoor mobile mmWave networks, in this paper, we introduce the reconfigurable 60 GHz reflect-arrays to establish robust mmWave connections for indoor networks even when the links are blocked by obstructions. First, the reconfigurable 60 GHz reflect-array is designed, implemented, and modeled. Then a three-party beam-searching protocol is designed for reflect-array-assisted 802.11ad networks. Finally, an optimal array deployment strategy is developed to minimize the link outage probability in indoor mobile mmWave networks. The proposed solution is validated and evaluated by both in-lab experiments and computer simulations.},

abstract = {Future Internet-of-Things (IoT) will connect billions of small computing devices embedded in the environment and support their device-to-device (D2D) communication. Powering the massive number of embedded devices is a key challenge of designing IoT, since batteries increase the devices' form factors and battery recharging/replacement is difficult. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel network architecture that enables D2D communication between passive nodes by integrating wireless power transfer and backscatter communication, which is called a wirelessly powered backscatter communication (WP-BackCom) network. In this network, standalone power beacons (PBs) are deployed for wirelessly powering nodes by beaming unmodulated carrier signals to targeted nodes. Provisioned with a backscatter antenna, a node transmits data to an intended receiver by modulating and reflecting a fraction of a carrier signal. Such transmission by backscatter consumes orders-of-magnitude less power than a traditional radio. Thereby, the dense deployment of low-complexity PBs with high transmission power can power a large-scale IoT. In this paper, a WP-BackCom network is modeled as a random Poisson cluster process in the horizontal plane where PBs are Poisson distributed and active ad hoc pairs of backscatter communication nodes with fixed separation distances form random clusters centered at PBs. The backscatter nodes can harvest energy from and backscatter carrier signals transmitted by PBs. Furthermore, the transmission power of each node depends on the distance from the associated PB. Applying stochastic geometry, the network coverage probability and transmission capacity are derived and optimized as functions of backscatter parameters, including backscatter duty cycle, reflection coefficient, and the PB density. The effects of the parameters on network performance are quantified.},

abstract = {We consider the downlink of Cell-Free Massive MIMO systems, where a very large number of distributed access points (APs) simultaneously serve a much smaller number of users. Each AP uses local channel estimates obtained from received uplink pilots and applies conjugate beamforming to transmit data to the users. We derive a closed-form expression for the achievable rate. This expression enables us to design an optimal max-min power control scheme that gives equal quality of service to all users. We further compare the performance of the Cell-Free Massive MIMO system to that of a conventional small-cell network and show that the throughput of the Cell-Free system is much more concentrated around its median compared to that of the smallcell system. The Cell-Free Massive MIMO system can provide an almost 20-fold increase in 95%-likely per-user throughput, compared with the small-cell system. Furthermore, Cell-Free systems are more robust to shadow fading correlation than smallcell systems.},

The new matrix rank-one decomposition theorems appear to have wide applications in theory as well as in practice. On the theoretical side, for example, we show how to further extend some of the classical results including a lemma due to Yuan (Math Program 47:53-63, 1990), the classical results on the convexity of the joint numerical ranges (Pang and Zhang in Unpublished Manuscript, 2004; Au-Yeung and Poon in Southeast Asian Bull Math 3:85-92, 1979), and the so-called Finsler's lemma (Bohnenblust in Unpublished Manuscript; Au-Yeung and Poon in Southeast Asian Bull Math 3:85-92, 1979). On the practical side, we show that the new results can be applied to solve two typical problems in signal processing and communication: one for radar code optimization and the other for robust beamforming. The new matrix decomposition theorems are proven by construction in this paper, and we demonstrate that the constructive procedures can be implemented efficiently, stably, and accurately. The URL of our Matlab programs is given in this paper. We strongly believe that the new decomposition procedures, as a means to solve non-convex quadratic optimization with a few quadratic constraints, are useful for many other potential engineering applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer and Mathematical Programming Society.},

abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted transmission and space shift keying (SSK) appear as promising candidates for future energy-efficient wireless systems. In this paper, two RIS-based SSK schemes are proposed to efficiently improve the error and throughput performance of conventional SSK systems, respectively. The first one, termed RIS-SSK with passive beamforming (RIS-SSK-PB), employs an RIS for beamforming and targets the maximization of the minimum squared Euclidean distance between any two decision points. The second one, termed RIS-SSK with Alamouti space-time block coding (RIS-SSK-ASTBC), employs an RIS for ASTBC and enables the RIS to transmit its own Alamouti-coded information while reflecting the incident SSK signals to the destination. A low-complexity beamformer and an efficient maximum-likelihood (ML) detector are designed for RIS-SSK-PB and RIS-SSK-ASTBC, respectively. Approximate expressions for the average bit error probabilities of the source and/or the RIS are derived in closed-form assuming ML detection. Extensive computer simulations are conducted to verify the performance analysis. Results show that RIS-SSK-PB significantly outperforms the existing RIS-free and RIS-based SSK schemes, and RIS-SSK-ASTBC enables highly reliable transmission with throughput improvement.},

abstract = {In this two-part paper, we study three capacity regions for fading broadcast channels and obtain their corresponding optimal resource allocation strategies: the ergodic (Shannon) capacity region, the zero-outage capacity region, and the capacity region with outage. In Part I, we obtained the ergodic capacity region of the fading broadcast channel under different spectrum-sharing techniques. In this paper, we derive the outage capacity regions of fading broadcast channels, assuming that both the transmitter and the receivers have perfect channel side information. These capacity regions and the associate optimal resource allocation policies are obtained for code division (CD) with and without successive decoding, for time division (TD), and for frequency division (FD). We show that in an M-user broadcast system, the outage capacity region is implicitly obtained by deriving the outage probability region for a given rate vector. Given the required rate of each user, we find a strategy which bounds the outage probability region for different spectrum-sharing techniques. The corresponding optimal power allocation scheme is a multiuser generalization of the threshold-decision rule for a single-user fading channel. Also discussed is a simpler minimum common outage probability problem under the assumption that the broadcast channel is either not used at all when fading is severe or used simultaneously for all users. Numerical results for the different outage capacity regions are obtained for the Nakagami-m fading model.},

abstract = {Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has emerged as a viable technique to energize and connect low-power autonomous devices and enable future Internet of Things (IoT). A major challenge of SWIPT is the energy consumption of the receiver of such low-power devices. An attractive low-power solution consists in an integrated information decoder (ID) and energy harvester (EH) architecture for SWIPT receiver (IntRx) where the received RF signal is first rectified before being used for information decoding. Such architecture eliminates the need for energy-consuming RF components such as local oscillators and mixers. This paper proposes a novel modulation and demodulation method for the IntRx SWIPT architecture based on pulse position modulation (PPM) where information is encoded in the position of the pulse. The new method transmits high amplitude pulses to increase the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal and exploits the EH's nonlinearity so as to boost the harvested DC power. Simultaneously, the information can be decoded from the rectifier signal by simply finding the position of the pulse in a certain symbol duration. We have analyzed both the information and the power transfer performance of the newly proposed PPM for IntRx SWIPT theoretically, numerically, and experimentally. To that end, we have established a SWIPT system testbed in an indoor environment by prototyping a base station to transfer information-power signal and the IntRx SWIPT receiver including ID and EH blocks. The performance evaluation of the PPM was carried out in various conditions, and the results have been compared and contrasted to conventional signals. Theoretical, numerical, and experimental results highlight the significant benefits of the proposed PPM scheme to enhance the power transfer performance and operate information decoding with low-power consumption.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop various beamforming techniques for downlink transmission for multiple-input single-output nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems. First, a beamforming approach with perfect channel state information is investigated to provide the required quality of service for all users. Taylor series approximation and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques are employed to reformulate the original nonconvex power minimization problem to a tractable one. Furthermore, a fairness-based beamforming approach is proposed through a max-min formulation to maintain fairness between users. Next, we consider a robust scheme by incorporating channel uncertainties, where the transmit power is minimized while satisfying the outage probability requirement at each user. Through exploiting the SDR approach, the original nonconvex problem is reformulated in a linear matrix inequality form to obtain the optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that the robust scheme can achieve better performance compared to the nonrobust scheme in terms of the rate satisfaction ratio. Furthermore, simulation results confirm that NOMA consumes a little over half transmit power needed by orthogonal multiple access for the same data rate requirements. Hence, NOMA has the potential to significantly improve the system performance in terms of transmit power consumption in future 5G networks and beyond.},

abstract = {Bistatic backscatter radio is expected to be applied in Internet of Things since it can achieve information transfer while consuming extreme low energy. However, no effort have been made to design an energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm with Quality of Service (QoS) requirement, and this observation motivates our work. In this paper, we consider a classical bistatic backscatter system, where the backscatter node first harvests energy from the dedicated power source in the sleep phase, then backscatters its information to the receiver and harvests energy simultaneously through a reflection coefficient in the active phase. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable energy efficiency, subject to the energy causality and QoS requirement, by optimizing the transmit power at the dedicated power source, the reflection coefficient, the time for sleep phase and active phase. As the formulated problem is a non-convex fractional programming problem and hard to solve, by means of the fractional programming, we firstly transform it in the fractional form as an equivalent problem in the subtractive form. By introducing several auxiliary variables and employing the monotonicity of the objective function, we show that the transformed problem can be reduced to one of the following two convex problems corresponding to two scenarios, i.e., the transmitter always operates in the active state and the dedicated power source adopts the maximum allowed power. Simulation results are provided to verify our findings and show the advantage of the proposed scheme in terms of energy efficiency.},

The SPs design their precoders as virtualization demands for user services, while the InP designs the actual precoding solution to meet the service demands from the SPs. Our aim is to minimize the long-term time-averaged expected precoding deviation over MIMO fading channels, subject to both per-cell long-term and short-term transmit power limits. We propose an online coordinated precoding algorithm for virtualization, which provides a fully distributed semi-closed-form precoding solution at each cell, based only on the current imperfect CSI without any CSI exchange across cells. Taking into account the two-fold impact of imperfect CSI on both the InP and the SPs, we show that our proposed algorithm is within an $O(\delta)$ gap from the optimum over any time horizon, where $\delta$ is a CSI inaccuracy indicator. Simulation results validate the performance of our proposed algorithm under two commonly used precoding techniques in a typical urban micro-cell network environment.},

abstract = {The idea of wireless power transfer (WPT) has been around since the inception of electricity. In the late 19th century, Nikola Tesla described the freedom to transfer energy between two points without the need for a physical connection to a power source as an ?all-surpassing importance to man? [1]. A truly wireless device, capable of being remotely powered, not only allows the obvious freedom of movement but also enables devices to be more compact by removing the necessity of a large battery. Applications could leverage this reduction in size and weight to increase the feasibility of concepts such as paper-thin, flexible displays [2], contact-lens-based augmented reality [3], and smart dust [4], among traditional point-to-point power transfer applications. While several methods of wireless power have been introduced since Tesla?s work, including near-field magnetic resonance and inductive coupling, laser-based optical power transmission, and far-field RF/microwave energy transmission, only RF/microwave and laser-based systems are truly long-range methods. While optical power transmission certainly has merit, its mechanisms are outside of the scope of this article and will not be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {User cooperation is an effective technique to tackle the severe near-far user unfairness problem in wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs). In this paper, we consider a WPCN where two collaborating wireless devices (WDs) first harvest wireless energy from a hybrid access point (HAP) and then transmit their information to the HAP. The WD with the stronger WD-to-HAP channel helps relay the message of the other weaker user. In particular, we exploit the use of ambient backscatter communication during the wireless energy transfer phase, where the weaker user backscatters the received energy signal to transmit its information to the relay user in a passive manner. By doing so, the relay user can reuse the energy signal for simultaneous energy harvesting and information decoding (e.g., using an energy detector). Compared to active information transmission in conventional WPCNs, the proposed method effectively saves the energy and time consumed by the weaker user on information transmission during cooperation. With the proposed backscatter-assisted relaying scheme, we jointly optimize the time and power allocations on wireless energy and information transmissions to maximize the common throughput. Specifically, we derive the semi-closed-form expressions of the optimal solution and propose an low-complexity optimal algorithm to solve the joint optimization problem. By comparing with some representative benchmark methods, we simulate under extensive network setups and demonstrate that the proposed cooperation method effectively improves the throughput performance in WPCNs.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate rate splitting (RS) for an uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system with a pair of near and far users adopting cyclic prefixed single carrier transmissions. Frequency-domain equalization is applied to assist successive interference cancellation at the base-station. Two kinds of RS schemes, namely, fixed RS (FRS) and cognitive RS (CRS) schemes, are proposed to realize RS for uplink NOMA with the aim of improving user fairness and outage performance in delay-limited transmissions. Corresponding to the split data streams, transmit power is allocated in either a fixed or cognitive manner for the FRS and CRS schemes, respectively. Based on achievable rate region analysis, the benefits of applying RS to uplink NOMA for enhancing the user fairness and outage performance are revealed. A modified Jain's index is proposed to measure the user fairness for the considered delay-limited transmissions. Closed-form expressions are derived for the outage probabilities of the paired users, respectively, whereas the preferred system parameters are chosen based on asymptotic outage probability expressions. The enhanced user fairness and superior outage performance of the proposed RS schemes are corroborated by Monte Carlo simulation results.},

abstract = {This work examines the idea of dislocating the carrier transmission from the tag-modulated carrier reception, i.e. bi-static rather than mono-static backscatter radio. In that way, more than one carrier transmitters can be distributed in a given geographical area and illuminate a set of RF tags/sensors that modulate and scatter the received carrier towards a single software-defined receiver. The increased number of carrier transmitters and their distributed nature assists tags to be potentially located closer to one carrier transmitter and thus, improves the power of the scattered signals towards the receiver. Specifically, this work a) carefully derives near-optimal detectors for bi-static backscatter radio and on/off keying (OOK) tag modulation (which is widely used in commercial tags), b) analytically calculates their bit error rate (BER) performance, and c) experimentally tests them in practice with a custom bistatic backscatter radio link. As a collateral dividend, it is shown that the non-linear processing of the proposed receivers requires certain attention on the utilized tag design principles, commonly overlooked in the literature, validating recently reported theoretical results on the microwave domain. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Backscatter communication (BackCom) has been emerging as a prospective candidate in tackling lifetime management problems for massively deployed Internet-of-things (IoT) devices, which suffer from battery related issues, i.e., replacements, charging, and recycling. This passive sensing approach allows a backscatter sensor node (BSN) to transmit information by reflecting the incident signal from a carrier emitter without initiating its transmission. To multiplex multiple BSNs, power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is fully exploited in this work. In this paper, we present the design and analysis of a NOMA enhanced bistatic BackCom system for a battery-less smart communication paradigm. Specifically, we derive the closed-form bit error rate (BER) expressions for a cluster of two devices in a bistatic BackCom system employing NOMA with imperfect successive interference cancellation under Nakagami- ${m}$ fading channel. The obtained expressions are utilized to evaluate the reflection coefficients of devices needed for the most favorable system performance along with the performance comparison with orthogonal multiple access-time domain multiple access scheme (OMA-TDMA).},

abstract = {We present a method for enhancing far-field wireless power transfer (WPT) to nonlinear, passive UHF RFID backscatter transponders using a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) base station. The proposed method does not require on-tag power measurements or on-tag channel estimation, either of which would add significant complexity and power consumption for microwatt-class wirelessly powered devices such as passive UHF RFID tags. We show in a measurement-based proof of concept that WPT optimization to nonlinear backscatter transponders is possible solely based on the backscatter signal, without knowledge of the incident power level at the tag or prior knowledge of the tag's characteristics. Using an 8×8 MIMO transceiver array to optimize power delivery, we observed an average WPT enhancement of 8.9 dB relative to an un-optimized 8-transmitter configuration across a 50m3 volume in an office/lab environment. We also show that power to a given tag can be selectively denied, with a notch depth of -106.4 dB (noise floor of the presented measurements). These results are comparable to values previously observed for linear backscatter transponders, and suggest that the use of MIMO interrogators could lead to improved forward-link performance and thus efficiently provide power for sensors or other new power-hungry functions on passive transponders. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

We are interested in the joint design of active transmit beamformer at the PTx and passive reflecting beamformer at the STx to minimize the total transmit power at the PTx, subject to the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) constraint for the secondary transmission and the rate constraint for the primary transmission. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we decouple the original problem into a series of subproblems using the alternating optimization method and then iteratively solve them. The convergence performance and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm are analyzed. Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity algorithm to design the reflecting beamformer by solving a backscatter link enhancement problem through the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique. Then, theoretical analysis is performed to reveal the insights of the proposed system.

In such scenarios, a secondary user (SU) can operate in either transmission mode or backscatter mode. Specifically, an SU can directly transmit data if sufficient energy has been harvested (i.e., transmission mode). Or an SU can backscatter ambient signals to transmit data (i.e., backscatter mode). In this paper, for investigating the performance of such systems, we apply stochastic geometry to analyze coverage probability and achievable rates for both primary and secondary users considering both communication modes.

However, most previous ambient RF harvesters have been narrowband, making mobile sensing scenarios infeasible: an RF harvester tuned to work in one city will not generally work in another, as the spectral environments tend to differ. This paper presents a novel approach to multiband harvesting. A single wideband antenna is followed by several narrowband rectifier chains. Each rectifier chain consists of a bandpass filter, a tuned impedance matching network, and a rectifier. The outputs of the rectifiers are combined via a novel diode summation network that enables good performance even when only a subset of the narrowband harvesters is excited. These techniques make ambient RF harvesting feasible for mobile applications. The techniques can potentially enable applications such as ambient RF-powered data logging sensors that upload data to RFID readers when in range. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {A touchstone for selecting two scattering states for scalar differential backscattering in passive scatterers was introduced by Green in 1963. According to this model, a scatterer has one global minimum and one global maximum scattering states on its $\Gamma$ plane. The variation of radar cross section (RCS) of the scatterer between these two states is monotonic. Thus, to achieve to the highest differential backscattering the scatterer should switch between these two states. In this paper, we verify, by measurements and simulations, that a linear half-wave dipole antenna behaves as predicted by the Green model. However, we show that the RCS of a T-match bow tie antenna over its $\Gamma$ plane cannot be modeled by the Green model and instead the antenna has two maximum scattering states on its $\Gamma$ plane. In the next step, we use dual loading on the T-match bowtie antenna structure. By appropriate selection of the loads, the antenna can provide various scattering states with various magnitudes in 360° phase span in its in-phase and quadrature plane. This feature of the proposed antenna can be used to increase the modulation depth up to 170%, provide a quasi-32-quasi-quadrature amplitude shift keying, and increase the coverage range in backscattering links.},

abstract = {In multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), multiple radio frequency (RF) chains are usually required to simultaneously transmit multiple data streams. As a special MIMO technology, spatial modulation (SM) activates one transmit antenna with one RF chain and exploits the index of the active antenna for information transfer at each time slot. Recently, reconfigurable metasurfaces have emerged as a promising technology that is able to reconfigure the wireless propagation environment by altering the amplitude and/or phase of the incident signal. In this article, we aim for the implementation of single-RF MIMO by shifting the focus from SM to metasurface-based modulation. Specifically, the principles of SM and metasurfaces are first presented. After reviewing the evolution of SM, we elaborate on the idea of metasurface-aided single-RF MIMO and discuss some implementations for it in line with notable variants of SM. A comparison between antenna-based and metasurface-based modulation is made to highlight the advantages of using metasurfaces. We finally investigate the research challenges and opportunities in the context of metasurface-based modulation.},

The NOMA beamforming design is formulated as a weighted sum rate maximization (WSRM) problem with decoding order constraints on the beamforming vectors and quality-of-service constraints for each user. We first investigate the feasibility of the NOMA WSRM problem and then propose an efficient method to achieve the optimized beamforming vectors. Furthermore, we consider the situation where user channels are homogeneous, which is particularly suitable for using NOMA. In this case, we show that the NOMA WSRM beamforming problem admits the favorable convexity and thus the optimal beamforming solution can be efficiently found. We further show that, with homogeneous channels, the optimal power allocation of the users can be analytically characterized.},

abstract = {Previous studies have confirmed the adverse impact of fading correlation on the mutual information (MI) of two-dimensional (2D) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. More recently, the trend is to enhance the system performance by exploiting the channels degrees of freedom in the elevation, which necessitates the derivation and characterization of three-dimensional (3D) channels in the presence of spatial correlation. In this paper, an exact closed-form expression for the Spatial Correlation Function (SCF) is derived for 3D MIMO channels. The proposed method resorts to the spherical harmonic expansion (SHE) of plane waves and the trigonometric expansion of Legendre and associated Legendre polynomials. The resulting expression depends on the underlying arbitrary angular distributions and antenna patterns through the Fourier Series (FS) coefficients of power azimuth and elevation spectrums. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the SCF being valid for any 3D propagation environment. The developed SCF determines the covariance matrices at the transmitter and the receiver that form the Kronecker channel model. In order to quantify the effects of correlation on system performance, the information-theoretic deterministic equivalents of the MI for the Kronecker model are utilized in both mono-user and multi-user cases. Numerical results validate the proposed analytical expressions and elucidate the dependence of the system performance on azimuth and elevation angular spreads and antenna patterns. Some useful insights into the behavior of MI as a function of downtilt angles are provided. The derived model will help evaluate the performance of correlated 3D MIMO channels in the future.},

abstract = {The design of wireless information and power transfer (WIPT) has so far relied on an oversimplified and inaccurate linear model of the energy harvester. In this paper, we depart from this linear model and design WIPT considering the rectifier nonlinearity. We develop a tractable model of the rectifier nonlinearity that is flexible enough to cope with general multicarrier modulated input waveforms. Leveraging that model, we motivate and introduce a novel WIPT architecture relying on the superposition of multicarrier unmodulated and modulated waveforms at the transmitter. The superposed WIPT waveforms are optimized as a function of the channel state information so as to characterize the rate-energy region of the whole system. Analysis and numerical results illustrate the performance of the derived waveforms and WIPT architecture and highlight that nonlinearity radically changes the design of WIPT. We make key and refreshing observations. First, analysis (confirmed by circuit simulations) shows that modulated and unmodulated waveforms are not equally suitable for wireless power delivery, namely, modulation being beneficial in single-carrier transmissions but detrimental in multicarrier transmissions. Second, a multicarrier unmodulated waveform (superposed to a multicarrier modulated waveform) is useful to enlarge the rate-energy region of WIPT. Third, a combination of power splitting and time sharing is in general the best strategy. Fourth, a nonzero mean Gaussian input distribution outperforms the conventional capacity-Achieving zero-mean Gaussian input distribution in multicarrier transmissions. Fifth, the rectifier nonlinearity is beneficial to system performance and is essential to efficient WIPT design.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have received considerable attention from the wireless communications research community recently. In particular, as low-cost passive devices, IRSs enable the control of the wireless propagation environment, which is not possible in conventional wireless networks. To take full advantage of such IRS-assisted communication systems, both the beamformer at the access point (AP) and the phase shifts at the IRS need to be optimally designed. However, thus far, the optimal design is not well understood. In this paper, a point-to-point IRS-assisted multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system is investigated. The beamformer at the AP and the IRS phase shifts are jointly optimized to maximize the spectral efficiency. Two efficient algorithms exploiting fixed point iteration and manifold optimization techniques, respectively, are developed for solving the resulting non-convex optimization problem. The proposed algorithms not only achieve a higher spectral efficiency but also lead to a lower computational complexity than the state-of-the-art approach. Simulation results reveal that deploying large-scale IRSs in wireless systems is more efficient than increasing the antenna array size at the AP for enhancing both the spectral and the energy efficiency.},

abstract = {Wireless and batteryless sensing has recently attracted significant attention of researchers in IoT and WSN applications. It turns out to be more challenging when simultaneous data acquisition from multiple sensors is required. This paper introduces a non-orthogonal multiple access technique MSMA, using extremely simple wireless and batteryless sensor tags and a reader to support concurrent streaming from multiple sensors. By simultaneously handling non-orthogonal subcarriers, produced either by multiple or single sensor tag, it can realize concurrent sensor data streaming, which can be used in health monitoring of machinery and civil structures. The paper explains the two primary challenges in MSMA, the optimal assignment of subcarrier frequencies and the unavoidable harmonics from one subcarrier to others. Since the mutual interference among subcarriers is unevenly distributed over the available frequency band, random allocation of subcarrier frequencies may result in degraded system performance. Results show that the interference can be canceled out with the signal processing technique and the system communication capacity can be increased significantly with a proposed heuristic approach compared to random allocation of subcarrier frequencies to the sensor tags.},

A novel application of backscattering, called ambient backscattering (AmBC), has been gaining much attention, wherein backscattering communications exploit existing RF signals without the need for a dedicated transmitter. In such a system, data demodulation process is strongly complicated by the random nature of the illuminating signal, as well as by the presence of the direct-link interference (DLI) from the legacy system. To overcome these shortcomings, one can resort to noncoherent detection strategies, aimed at reducing or even nullifying the amount of a priori information needed to reliably perform signal demodulation.

To ensure fairness between devices, we formulate common-throughput maximization problem where an algorithm for time allocation is presented. Compared with 'Non-cooperation mode' (i.e., no information exchange via AB) and active RF based cooperation schemes, the proposed scheme is shown to increase both the coverage and fairness between devices for battery-less IoT networks. We then generalize the architecture of backscatter-aided cooperative transmission with multiple-device cooperation where the information exchange is performed in sequential mode and parallel (broadcasting) mode. In the sequential mode, a graph-matching based suboptimal pairing algorithm is proposed whose validity is corroborated through comparison with a heuristic search based optimal pairing, and then we compare the two modes for multiple-device cooperation.},

abstract = {With the commencement of the 5th generation (5G) of wireless networks, researchers around the globe have started paying their attention to the imminent challenges that may emerge in the beyond 5G (B5G) era. Various revolutionary technologies and innovative services are offered in 5G networks, which, along with many principal advantages, are anticipated to bring a boom in the number of connected wireless devices and the types of use-cases that may cause the scarcity of network resources. These challenges partly emerged with the advent of massive machine-type communications (mMTC) services, require extensive research innovations to sustain the evolution towards enhanced-mMTC (e-mMTC) with the scalable network cost in 6th generation (6G) wireless networks. Towards delivering the anticipated massive connectivity requirements with optimal energy and spectral efficiency besides low hardware cost, this paper presents an enabling framework for 6G networks, which utilizes two emerging technologies, namely, non-coherent communications and backscatter communications (BsC). Recognizing the coherence between these technologies for their joint potential of delivering e-mMTC services in the B5G era, a comprehensive review of their state-of-the-art is conducted. The joint scope of non-coherent and BsC with other emerging 6G technologies is also identified, where the reviewed technologies include unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted communications, visible light communications (VLC), quantum-assisted communications, reconfigurable large intelligent surfaces (RLIS), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and machine learning (ML)-aided intelligent networks. Subsequently, the scope of these enabling technologies for different device types (e.g., UAVs, body implants, etc), service types (e.g., e-mMTC), and optimization parameters (e.g., spectrum, energy, cost) is analyzed. Finally, in the context of the proposed non-coherent and BsCs based framework for e-mMTCs, some promising future research directions and open research challenges are highlighted.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the passive beamforming and information transfer (PBIT) technique for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (Mu-MIMO) systems with the aid of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), where the RISs enhance the primary communication via passive beamforming (P-BF) and at the same time deliver additional information by the on-off reflecting modulation (in which the RIS information is carried by the on/off state of each reflecting element). For the P-BF design, we propose to maximize the achievable user sum rate of the RIS-aided Mu-MIMO channel and formulate the problem as a two-step stochastic program. A sample average approximation (SAA) based iterative algorithm is developed for the efficient P-BF design of the considered scheme. To strike a balance between complexity and performance, we further propose a simplified P-BF algorithm by approximating the stochastic program as a deterministic alternating optimization problem. For the receiver design, the signal detection at the receiver is a bilinear estimation problem since the RIS information is multiplicatively modulated onto the reflected signals of the reflecting elements. To solve this bilinear estimation problem, we develop a turbo message passing (TMP) algorithm in which the factor graph associated with the problem is divided into two modules: one for the estimation of the user signals and the other for the estimation of the on-off state of each RIS element. The two modules are executed iteratively to yield a near-optimal low-complexity solution. Furthermore, we extend the design of the Mu-MIMO PBIT scheme from single-RIS to multi-RIS, by leveraging the similarity between the single-RIS and multi-RIS system models. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the advantages of our P-BF and receiver designs.},

abstract = {To meet with both the energy and spectral efficiency, cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) (termed as CNOMA) and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) are integrated in this paper. Two different protocols such as CNOMA-SWIPT-PS and CNOMA-SWIPT-TS are proposed, by employing power-splitting (PS) and time-switching (TS) energy harvesting (EH) techniques, respectively. In the proposed protocols, a base station (BS) directly communicates with a NOMA near user, whereas the communication with a NOMA far user is performed with the assistance of an energy-constrained relay node. The relay node harvests energy from the transmitted signal by the BS, employing PS or TS EH technique. We investigate ergodic sum capacity and outage probability of the proposed protocols along with analytical derivations over Nakagami-m fading channels. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed schemes over existing strategy and conventional multiple access is demonstrated through analysis and simulation.},

abstract = {Recently, joint wireless information and energy transfer (JWIET) methods have been proposed to relieve the battery limitation of wireless devices. However, the JWIET in a general K-user MIMO interference channel (IFC) has been unexplored so far. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the JWIET in K-user MIMO IFC, in which receivers either decode the incoming information data (information decoding, ID) or harvest the RF energy (energy harvesting, EH). In the K-user IFC, we consider three different scenarios according to the receiver mode: i) multiple EH receivers and a single ID receiver, ii) multiple IDs and a single EH, and iii) multiple IDs and multiple EHs. For all scenarios, we have found a common necessary condition of the optimal transmission strategy and, accordingly, developed the transmission strategy that satisfies the common necessary condition, in which all the transmitters transferring energy exploit a rank-one energy beamforming. Furthermore, we have also proposed an iterative algorithm to optimize the covariance matrices of the transmitters that transfer information and the powers of the energy beamforming transmitters simultaneously, and identified the corresponding achievable rate-energy tradeoff region. Finally, we have shown that by selecting EH receivers according to their signal-to-leakage-and-harvested energy-ratio (SLER), we can improve the achievable rate-energy region further.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a revolutionary and transformative technology for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless communication cost-effectively in the future. Specifically, an IRS consists of a large number of low-cost passive elements each being able to reflect the incident signal independently with an adjustable phase shift so as to collaboratively achieve three-dimensional (3D) passive beamforming without the need of any transmit radio-frequency (RF) chains. In this paper, we study an IRS-aided single-cell wireless system where one IRS is deployed to assist in the communications between a multi-antenna access point (AP) and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate and solve new problems to minimize the total transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming by active antenna array at the AP and reflect beamforming by passive phase shifters at the IRS, subject to users' individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance of IRS's passive beamforming with infinitely large number of reflecting elements and compare it to that of the traditional active beamforming/relaying. Simulation results demonstrate that an IRS-aided MIMO system can achieve the same rate performance as a benchmark massive MIMO system without using IRS, but with significantly reduced active antennas/RF chains. We also draw useful insights into optimally deploying IRS in future wireless systems.},

abstract = {Power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has become a promising technology to exploit the new dimension of the power domain to enhance the spectral efficiency of wireless networks. However, most existing NOMA schemes rely on the strong assumption that users&#x2019; channel gains are quite different, which may be invalid in practice. To unleash the potential of power-domain NOMA, we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered NOMA scheme to introduce desirable channel gain differences among the users by adjusting the phase shifts at the RIS. Our goal is to minimize the total transmit power by jointly optimizing the beamforming vectors at the base station, the phase-shift matrix at the RIS, and user ordering. To address challenge due to the highly coupled optimization variables, we present an alternating optimization framework to decompose the non-convex bi-quadratically constrained quadratic problem under a specific user ordering into two rank-one constrained matrices optimization problems via matrix lifting. To accurately detect the feasibility of the non-convex rank-one constraints and improve performance by avoiding early stopping in the alternating optimization procedure, we equivalently represent the rank-one constraint as the difference between nuclear norm and spectral norm. A difference-of-convex (DC) algorithm is further developed to solve the resulting DC programs via successive convex relaxation, followed by establishing the convergence of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization method. We further propose an efficient user ordering scheme with closed-form expressions, considering both the channel conditions and users&#x2019; target data rates. Simulation results validate the ability of an RIS in enlarging the channel-gain difference when the users&#x2019; original channel conditions are similar and the superiority of the proposed DC-based alternating optimization method in reducing the total transmit power.},

Our approach considers both coherent and non-coherent OSTBC so that systems with and without channel state information can be considered. To allow the application of OSTBC, we develop an approximate linearized and normalized multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel model for the AmBC system.

We propose several iterative methods to solve the non-convex energy BF problem with and without approximation of the NLEH function. In addition, we present an asymptotic energy BF problem for a large-antenna system that can be solved at low complexity. The results show that the algorithms developed with a simple NLEH approximation provide almost the same performance with the algorithms developed with the exact NLEH function. Furthermore, the sensitivity region of the NLEH should be considered more carefully than the saturation region in the max-min rate optimization problem.},

abstract = {The computation of the channel capacity of discrete memoryless channels is a convex problem that can be efficiently solved using the Arimoto-Blahut (AB) iterative algorithm. However, the extension of this algorithm to the computation of capacity regions of multiterminal networks is not straightforward since it gives rise to non-convex problems. In this context, the AB algorithm has only been successfully extended to the calculation of the sum-capacity of the discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (DMAC). Thus, the computation of the whole capacity region still requires the use of computationally demanding search methods. In this paper, we first give an alternative reformulation of the capacity region of the DMAC which condenses all the nonconvexities of the problem into a single rank-one constraint. Then, we propose efficient methods to compute outer and inner bounds on the capacity region of the two-user DMAC by solving a relaxed version of the problem and projecting its solution onto the original feasible set. Targeting numerical results, we first take a randomization approach. Focusing on analytical results, we study projection via minimum divergence, which amounts to the marginalization of the relaxed solution. In this case we derive sufficient conditions and necessary and sufficient conditions for the bounds to be tight. Furthermore, we are able to show that the class of channels for which the marginalization bounds match exactly the capacity region includes all the two-user binaryinput deterministic DMACs as well as other non-deterministic channels.

abstract = {This paper analyzes the channel uncertainty which is a fundamental issue for the information theory of the time varying mobile communication channels. We use an accumulated common experience to define six axioms related to the non trivial influence of the channel uncertainty to the information capacity of time-varying communication channels. Based on these axioms, we propose the concept of Time Varying Binary Symmetric Channel (TV-BSC). We show that the TV-BSC is unique as the simplest model that exhibits a non-trivial influence on capacity due to the channel uncertainty. That an influence of the channel uncertainty is captured serves to significantly differentiate the model from other two-state Markov models, especially from the the Gilbert-Elliott model. We use several methods to calculate the information capacity of the TV-BSC. Furthermore, we find accurate approximations for the TV-BSC information capacity, providing better inside into the capacity analysis of more general time varying communication channels. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

We show that a rotated $2^b$-phase shift keying scheme is the capacity-achieving input distribution for a complex AWGN channel with $b$-bit phase quantization. The result is then used to establish the expression for the channel capacity as a function of average power constraint $P$ and quantization bits $b$. The outage performance of phase-quantized system is also investigated for the case of Rayleigh fading when the channel state information (CSI) is only known at the receiver. Our findings suggest the existence of a threshold in the rate $R$, above which the outage exponent of the outage probability changes abruptly. In fact, this threshold effect in the outage exponent causes $2^b$-PSK to have suboptimal outage performance at high SNR.},

abstract = {The heterogenous wireless services and exponentially growing traffic call for novel spectrum- and energy-efficient wireless communication technologies. Recently, a new technique, called symbiotic radio (SR), is proposed to exploit the benefits and address the drawbacks of cognitive radio (CR) and ambient backscattering communications (AmBC), leading to mutualism spectrum sharing and highly reliable backscattering communications. In particular, the secondary transmitter (STx) in SR transmits messages to the secondary receiver (SRx) over the RF signals originating from the primary transmitter (PTx) based on cognitive backscattering communications, thus the secondary system shares not only the radio spectrum, but also the power, and infrastructure with the primary system. In return, the secondary transmission provides beneficial multipath diversity to the primary system, therefore the two systems form mutualism spectrum sharing. More importantly, joint decoding is exploited at SRx to achieve highly reliable backscattering communications. In this article, to exploit the full potential of SR, we provide a systematic view for SR and address three fundamental tasks in SR: (1) enhancing the backscattering link via active load; (2) achieving highly reliable communications through joint decoding; and (3) capturing PTx's RF signals using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces. Emerging applications, design challenges and open research problems will also be discussed.},

abstract = {Far-field Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has attracted significant attention in recent years. Despite the rapid progress, the emphasis of the research community in the last decade has remained largely concentrated on improving the design of energy harvester (so-called rectenna) and has left aside the effect of transmitter design. In this paper, we study the design of transmit waveform so as to enhance the dc power at the output of the rectenna. We derive a tractable model of the nonlinearity of the rectenna and compare with a linear model conventionally used in the literature. We then use those models to design novel multisine waveforms that are adaptive to the channel state information (CSI). Interestingly, while the linear model favours narrowband transmission with all the power allocated to a single frequency, the nonlinear model favours a power allocation over multiple frequencies. Through realistic simulations, waveforms designed based on the nonlinear model are shown to provide significant gains (in terms of harvested dc power) over those designed based on the linear model and over nonadaptive waveforms. We also compute analytically the theoretical scaling laws of the harvested energy for various waveforms as a function of the number of sinewaves and transmit antennas. Those scaling laws highlight the benefits of CSI knowledge at the transmitter in WPT and of a WPT design based on a nonlinear rectenna model over a linear model. Results also motivate the study of a promising architecture relying on large-scale multisine multiantenna waveforms for WPT. As a final note, results stress the importance of modeling and accounting for the nonlinearity of the rectenna in any system design involving wireless power.},

In this letter, we solve the total rate maximization problem for a multi-carrier wireless powered BackCom network, where a dedicated radio frequency power source (PS) transmits multi-carrier signals to a hybrid Information transceiver device (iTD) during energy harvesting (EH) phase, and then the ITD deliveries the signals to the associated receiver during the Information transmission (iT) phase. Our goal Is to maximize the sum rate of the backscatter data rate and the transmission rate during the IT phase by jointly optimizing power allocation, time allocation, reflection coefficient, energy allocation coefficient, where the maximum transmit power constraint at the PS and the minimum circuit power consumption constraint are considered. Then an Iterative RA algorithm Is developed to find the optimal solutions. Simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme In terms of transmission rates.},

In this paper, the capacity of a discrete time, memoryless and complex Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel in the presence of a nonlinear energy harvester at the receiver is studied. Considering the two common nonlinear energy harvester models introduced in the literature, two sets of constraints are considered. First the capacity is studied under average power (AP), peak amplitude (PA) and receiver delivery power (RDP) constraints. The RDP constraint is modelled as a linear combination of even-moment statistics of the channel input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the capacity of an AWGN channel under AP and RDP constraints is the same as the capacity of an AWGN channel under an AP constraint, however, depending on the two constraints, it can be either achieved or arbitrarily approached. It is also shown that under AP, PA and RDP constraints, the amplitude of the optimal inputs is discrete with a finite number of mass points. Next, the capacity is studied under AP, PA and output outage probability (OOP) constraints. OOP is modelled as satisfying a certain probability inequality for the amplitude of the received signal being outside of a given interval. Similarly, it is shown that the amplitude of the optimal input is discrete with a finite number of mass points.},

abstract = {In this paper we study semidefinite programming (SDP) models for a class of discrete and continuous quadratic optimization problems in the complex Hermitian form. These problems capture a class of well-known combinatorial optimization problems, as well as problems in control theory. For instance, they include the MAX-3-CUT problem where the Laplacian matrix is positive semidefinite (in particular, some of the edge weights can be negative). We present a generic algorithm and a unified analysis of the SDP relaxations which allow us to obtain good approximation guarantees for our models. Specifically, we give an (k sin($\pi$/k))2/(4$\pi$) -approximation algorithm for the discrete problem where the decision variables are k-ary and the objective matrix is positive semidefinite. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known approximation result for this family of problems. For the continuous problem where the objective matrix is positive semidefinite, we obtain the well-known $\pi$ /4 result due to Ben-Tal et al. [Math Oper Res 28(3):497-523, 2003], and independently, Zhang and Huang [SIAM J Optim 16(3):871-890, 2006]. However, our techniques simplify their analyses and provide a unified framework for treating those problems. In addition, we show for the first time that the gap between the optimal value of the original problem and that of the SDP relaxation can be arbitrarily close to $\pi$ /4. We also show that the unified analysis can be used to obtain an $\Omega$(1/ log n)-approximation algorithm for the continuous problem in which the objective matrix is not positive semidefinite. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

To reveal the SWIPT mechanism and evaluate the SWIPT performance, we establish an analytical end-to-end (E2E) transmission model based on a modular approach and the electromagnetic field propagation. Then, the intra-cavity power intensity distribution, transmission loss, output power, and E2E efficiency can be obtained. The numerical evaluation illustrates that the exemplary RB-SWIPT system can provide about 4.20W electric power and 12.41bps/Hz spectral efficiency, and shorter transmission distance or larger retro-reflecting surface size can lead to higher E2E efficiency. The RB-SWIPT presents a new way for high-power, long-range WPT, and high-rate communication.},

However, the weak RF energy harvested and the short BC distance have become the two critical obstacles in the real-world implementation of this potential technology. In this paper, we propose a high-sensitivity RF energy harvesting (RFEH) and long-distance BC method, and for the first time, we demonstrate the RF-powered self-sustainable long-distance BC device named RFEH LoRa. In order to improve RFEH sensitivity, an ultra-low power (ULP) consumption voltage monitoring and startup control circuit topology is designed to reduce the power consumption to 245 nanowatt (nW) during the accumulation of RF energy. While in order to increase the BC distance, a direct digital frequency synthesis (DDS) technology is used to generate a linear frequency modulation (LFM) square wave sequence conforming to the LoRa specifications based on the ULP microcontroller unit (MCU), and the square wave is used to drive an RF switch to achieve long-distance BC of hundreds of meters. Test results show that the instantaneous BC current is as low as 130 microampere (lA), and the standby current is only 52 nanoampere (nA). RFEH LoRa is implemented with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. It can self-startup by harvesting RF energy as low as.22.5 dBm, and send its sensing data to the receiver of 381 meters away.},

Solutions include maximum and minimum access interval, the maximum and minimum duty cycle, and the minimal RF-harvested energy under the energy condition for node operating. Using the solutions above, the maximum throughput of passive QAM backscatter communication systems is analyzed and numerical calculation is made finally. Numerical calculation shows that the maximal throughput decreases with the consumed power and the number of sensors, and the maximum throughput is decreased quickly with the increase of the number of sensors. Especially, for a given consumed power of sensor, it can be seen that the throughput decreases with the duty cycle and the number of sensors has little effect on the throughput.},

It has been illustrated that for the synchronous code division multiple access (CDMA) scenario, the so-called semidefinite relaxation (SDR) algorithm can accurately and efficiently approximate multiuser MLD. This SDR-MLD algorithm, however, can only handle binary and quadratic phase shift keying (PSK) symbol constellations. In this sequel, we propose an extended SDR algorithm for MLD with M-ary PSK (MPSK) constellations.

abstract = {This paper investigates the secure transmit design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer system under the non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model, where a transmitter sends confidential information and transfers energy to multiple information receivers (IRs) and EH receivers (ERs) with the existence of multiple eavesdroppers (Eves). To prevent confidential information leakage, multiple artificial redundant signals (MARSs) are embedded in the transmit signals. The goal is to minimize the total transmit power by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming vectors and the covariance matrixes of MARSs, such that the minimal information rate and EH requirements at IRs and ERs are guaranteed while making the received signal-to-Interference ratio at ERs and Eves lower than their information decoding thresholds. Both the non-robust and the robust designs are studied. For the non-robust design, the optimal solution is derived. For the robust design, an approximate optimal solution is obtained by using Gaussian randomization procedure. Simulation results show that compared with traditional non-MARS-aided beamforming design, our proposed design is superior in terms of the total required transmit power. It also shows that employing the non-linear EH model can avoid false output power at the ERs and/or save power at the transmitter.},

Meanwhile, ambient backscatter communication is a promising solution to the Internet of Things (IoT), due to its high spectrum efficiency and power efficiency. In this paper, we are interested in a symbiotic system of cellular and IoT networks and propose a backscatter-NOMA system, which incorporates a downlink NOMA system with a backscatter device (BD). In the proposed system, the base station (BS) transmits information to two cellular users according to the NOMA protocol, while a BD transmits its information over the BS signals to one cellular user using the passive radio technology. In particular, if the BS only serves the cellular user that decodes BD information, the backscatter-NOMA system turns into a symbiotic radio (SR) system. We derive the expressions of the outage probabilities and the ergodic rates and analyze the corresponding diversity orders and slopes for both backscatter-NOMA and SR systems. Finally, we provide the numerical results to verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the interrelationship between the cellular networks and the IoT networks.},

abstract = {Low-power ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) relying on radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesting is an energy-efficient solution for batteryless Internet of Things (IoT). However, ambient backscatter signals are severely faded by dyadic backscatter channel (DBC), limiting connectivity in conventional orthogonal time-division-based AmBC (TD-AmBC). In order to support massive connectivity in AmBC, we propose sparse-coded AmBC (SC-AmBC) based on non-orthogonal signaling. Sparse code utilizes inherent sparsity of AmBC where power supplies of RF tags rely on ambient RF energy harvesting. Consequently, sparse-coded backscatter modulation algorithm (SC-BMA) can enable non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) as well as M-ary modulation for concurrent backscatter transmissions, providing additional diversity gain. These sparse codewords from multiple tags can be efficiently detected at access point (AP) using iterative message passing algorithm (MPA). To overcome DBC along with intersymbol interference (ISI), we propose dyadic channel estimation algorithm (D-CEA) and dyadic MPA (D-MPA) exploiting weighted-sum of the ISI for information exchange in the factor graph. Simulation results validate the potential of the SC-AmBC in terms of connectivity, detection performance and sum throughput.},

abstract = {In this work, we show how modulated backscatter signals can be crafted to yield channelized band-pass signals akin to those transmitted by many conventional wireless devices. As a result, conventional wireless devices can receive these backscattered signals without any modification (neither hardware nor software) to the conventional wireless device. We present a proof of concept using the Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy, or BLE, standard widely available on smart phones and mobile devices. Our prototype backscatter tag produces three-channel bandpass frequency shift keying (FSK) packets at 1 Mbps that are indistinguishable from conventional BLE advertising packets. An unmodified Apple iPad is shown to correctly receive and display these packets at a range of over 9.4 m using its existing iOS Bluetooth stack with no changes whatsoever. We create all three BLE channels by backscattering a single incident CW carrier using a novel combination of fundamentalmode and harmonic-mode backscatter subcarrier modulation, with two of the band-pass channels generated by the fundamental mode and one of the band-pass channels generated by the second harmonic mode. The backscatter modulator consumes only 28.4 pJ/bit, compared with over 10 nJ/bit for conventional BLE transmitters. The backscatter approach yields over 100X lower energy per bit than a conventional BLE transmitter, while retaining compatibility with billions of existing Bluetooth enabled smartphones and mobile devices.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the optimal resource allocation algorithm design for large intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. To facilitate efficient system design for large IRSs, instead of jointly optimizing all the IRS elements, we partition the IRS into several tiles and employ a scalable optimization framework comprising an offline design stage and an online optimization stage. In the offline stage, the IRS elements of each tile are jointly designed to support a set of different phase shift configurations, referred to as transmission modes, while the best transmission mode is selected from the set for each tile in the online stage. Given a transmission mode set, we aim to minimize the total base station (BS) transmit power by jointly optimizing the beamforming and the transmission mode selection policy taking into account the quality-of-service requirements of information decoding and non-linear energy harvesting receivers, respectively. Although the resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex combinatorial optimization problem, we solve it optimally by applying the branch-and-bound (BnB) approach which entails a high computational complexity. To strike a balance between optimality and computational complexity, we also develop an efficient suboptimal algorithm capitalizing on the penalty method and successive convex approximation. Our simulation results show that the proposed designs enable considerable power savings compared to several baseline schemes. Moreover, our results reveal that by properly adjusting the numbers of tiles and transmission modes, the proposed scalable optimization framework indeed facilitates online design for large IRSs.},

abstract = {This paper studies a novel user cooperation method in a wireless powered cooperative communication network (WPCN) in which a pair of distributed terminal users first harvest wireless energy broadcasted by one energy node and then use the harvested energy to transmit information to a destination node (DN). In particular, the two cooperating users exchange their independent information with each other so as to form a virtual antenna array and transmit jointly to the DN. By allowing the users to share their harvested energy to transmit each other's information, the proposed method can effectively mitigate the inherent user unfairness problem in WPCN, where one user may suffer from very low data rate due to poor energy harvesting performance and high data transmission consumptions. Depending on the availability of channel state information at the transmitters, we consider the two users cooperating using either coherent or non-coherent data transmissions. In both cases, we derive the maximum common throughput achieved by the cooperation schemes through optimizing the time allocation on wireless energy transfer, user message exchange, and joint information transmissions in a fixed-length time slot. We also perform numerical analysis to study the impact of channel conditions on the system performance. By comparing with some existing benchmark schemes, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed user cooperation in a WPCN under different application scenarios.},

In this paper, our objectives were to realize harvester operation at typical ambient RF power levels found within urban and semi-urban environments. To explore the potential for ambient RF energy harvesting, a city-wide RF spectral survey was undertaken from outside all of the 270 London Underground stations at street level. Using the results from this survey, four harvesters (comprising antenna, impedance-matching network, rectifier, maximum power point tracking interface, and storage element) were designed to cover four frequency bands from the largest RF contributors (DTV, GSM900, GSM1800, and 3G) within the ultrahigh frequency (0.3-3 GHz) part of the frequency spectrum. Prototypes were designed and fabricated for each band. The overall end-to-end efficiency of the prototypes using realistic input RF power sources is measured; with our first GSM900 prototype giving an efficiency of 40%. Approximately half of the London Underground stations were found to be suitable locations for harvesting ambient RF energy using our four prototypes. Furthermore, multiband array architectures were designed and fabricated to provide a broader freedom of operation. Finally, an output dc power density comparison was made between all the ambient RF energy harvesters, as well as alternative energy harvesting technologies, and for the first time, it is shown that ambient RF harvesting can be competitive with the other technologies.{\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {As backscatter-based IoT applications get proliferated, how to exploit backscattered signals for efficient sensing becomes a significant issue. Backscatter-based sensing requires accurate estimation of a backscatter channel (phase and amplitude), which is distorted when multiple signals collide with each other. As a result, the state of the arts is limited to either parallel decoding of collided signal or channel estimation with clean signal. Motivated by the need of high sensing capacity, we in this article present Fireworks, the first approach for channel estimation of parallel backscattered signals. The insight of Fireworks is that although the channel is distorted due to collision, the movements of the ON-OFF Keying modulated signal still preserve the channel properties of the respective tags. By modeling the relationship between the channels and the signal's moving trajectory in the IQ domain, one can make accurate estimation of the channels directly from the collision. We address practical problems of Fireworks, such as the high computing complexity and the compatibility with the commercial MAC protocol, and implement Fireworks. The results show that Fireworks is able to estimate the channels of up to five tags in parallel. When applied to the tracking application, Fireworks achieves 2$\sim$4x improvement in the tracking accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art approach.},

Uniquely, this paper studies the optimization of the sum-rate of RSMA with imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter (CSIT) and the receivers (CSIR). The robustness of the RSMA approach against imperfect CSIT has been investigated in the previous studies while there has been no consideration for the effects of imperfect CSIR. This motivates us to develop a robust design relying on RSMA in the presence of both imperfect CSIT and CSIR. Since the optimization problem for the design of RSMA precoder and power allocations to maximize the sum-rate is non-convex, it is hard to solve directly. To tackle the non-convexity, we propose a novel alternating optimization algorithm based on semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and concave-convex procedure (CCCP) techniques. By comparing simulation results with conventional methods, it turns out that RSMA is quite robust to imperfect CSIR and CSIT, thereby improving the sum-rate performance.},

abstract = {Low power wide area (LPWA) networks are attracting a lot of attention primarily because of their ability to offer affordable connectivity to the low-power devices distributed over very large geographical areas. In realizing the vision of the Internet of Things, LPWA technologies complement and sometimes supersede the conventional cellular and short range wireless technologies in performance for various emerging smart city and machine-to-machine applications. This review paper presents the design goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies exploit to offer wide-area coverage to low-power devices at the expense of low data rates. We survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI) as well as the industrial consortia built around individual LPWA technologies (e.g., LoRa Alliance, Weightless-SIG, and Dash7 alliance). We further note that LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing similar limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research challenges and identifies potential directions to address them. While the proprietary LPWA technologies are already hitting the market with large nationwide roll-outs, this paper encourages an active engagement of the research community in solving problems that will shape the connectivity of tens of billions of devices in the next decade.},

In this system, the secrecy rate is maximized by controlling the on-off status of each IRS as well as optimizing the phase shift matrix of the IRSs. This problem is posed as a joint optimization problem of transmit beamforming and IRS control, whose goal is to maximize the secrecy rate under the total transmission power and unit-modulus constraints. The problem is difficult to solve optimally due to the nonconvexity of constraint conditions and coupled variables. To deal with this problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and manifold optimization (MO) technologies. Numerical simulations show that the proposed AO-based algorithm can effectively improve the secrecy rate and outperforms traditional single IRS-Aided scheme.},

In particular, it is shown that using a single transmit antenna and K receive antennas; significant savings in energy vs. a K×K MIMO can be achieved [1]. This article proves that, a 1 × K media-based modulation over a static multi-path channel asymptotically achieves the capacity of K parallel AWGN channels, where for each unit of energy over the single transmit antenna, the effective energy for each of the K AWGN channels is the statistical average of channel fading. The rate of convergence is computed. Significant gains can be realized even in a SISO media-based setup. An example for the practical construction of the system and its realistic RF simulation are presented. Issues of equalization and selection gain are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

This letter proposes a differential reflecting modulation (DRM) scheme for RIS based communication systems. In DRM, information bits are jointly carried by the activation permutations of the reflecting patterns and the phases of the transmitted signals, leading to that DRM can work without any channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, RIS or receiver. In other words, DRM can release the intricate and resource-consuming channel estimation in the transmission process. Simulation results show that the proposed DRM pays an acceptable SNR penalty compared to non-differential modulation with coherent detection.},

Backscatter communication systems, on the other hand, modulate an antenna's impedance to encode information into already existing waves but suffer from low data rates and a lack of information security. Here, we introduce the concept of massive backscatter communication which modulates the propagation environment of stray ambient waves with a programmable metasurface. The metasurface's large aperture and huge number of degrees of freedom enable unprecedented wave control and thereby secure and high-speed information transfer. Our prototype leveraging existing commodity 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi signals achieves data rates on the order of hundreds of Kbps. Our technique is applicable to all types of wave phenomena and provides a fundamentally new perspective on the role of metasurfaces in future wireless communication.},

In this paper, we propose a distributed IRS-empowered communication network architecture, where multiple sourcedestination pairs communicate through multiple distributed IRSs. We further contribute to maximize the achievable sum-rates in this network via jointly optimizing the transmit power vector at the sources and the phase shift matrix with passive beamforming at all distributed IRSs. Unfortunately, this problem turns out to be non-convex and highly intractable, for which an alternating approach is developed via solving the resulting fractional programming problems alternatively. In particular, the closed-form expressions are proposed for coordinated passive beamforming at IRSs.

First, the method makes it possible to measure a chip's impedance in activation state, which requires large input power, not compatible with VNA measurements. Second, this method realizes a real-time measurement, which consists in impedance measurement as a function of time. Therefore, this real-time measurement makes it possible to detect and measure the impedance changes of an actual contactless smart card's integrated circuit during a load modulation communication at different powers. Finally, this real-time impedance measurement gives important information on chips' electrical characteristics that can be used to optimize near-field communication devices design in order to reduce the power losses within an RF identification tag.},

abstract = {The novel concept of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is investigated, where the incident wireless signal is divided into transmitted and reflected signals passing into both sides of the space surrounding the surface, thus facilitating a full-space manipulation of signal propagation. Based on the introduced basic signal model of `STAR', three practical operating protocols for STAR-RISs are proposed, namely energy splitting (ES), mode switching (MS), and time switching (TS). Moreover, a STAR-RIS aided downlink communication system is considered for both unicast and multicast transmission, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) sends information to two users, i.e., one on each side of the STAR-RIS. A power consumption minimization problem for the joint optimization of the active beamforming at the BS and the passive transmission and reflection beamforming at the STAR-RIS is formulated for each of the proposed operating protocols, subject to communication rate constraints of the users. For ES, the resulting highly-coupled non-convex optimization problem is solved by an iterative algorithm, which exploits the penalty method and successive convex approximation. Then, the proposed penalty-based iterative algorithm is extended to solve the mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem for MS. For TS, the optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems, which can be consecutively solved using state-of-the-art algorithms and convex optimization techniques. Finally, our numerical results reveal that: 1) the TS and ES operating protocols are generally preferable for unicast and multicast transmission, respectively; and 2) the required power consumption for both scenarios is significantly reduced by employing the proposed STAR-RIS instead of conventional reflecting/transmiting-only RISs.},

abstract = {This paper investigates a novel intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-based symbiotic radio (SR) system architecture consisting of a transmitter, an IRS, and an information receiver (IR). The primary transmitter communicates with the IR and at the same time assists the IRS in forwarding information to the IR. Based on the IRS's symbol period, we distinguish two scenarios, namely, commensal SR (CSR) and parasitic SR (PSR), where two different techniques for decoding the IRS signals at the IR are employed. We formulate bit error rate (BER) minimization problems for both scenarios by jointly optimizing the active beamformer at the base station and the phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a minimum primary rate requirement. Specifically, for the CSR scenario, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality solution, where semi-closed-form solutions for the active beamformer and the IRS phase shifts are derived based on Lagrange duality and Majorization-Minimization methods, respectively. For the PSR scenario, we apply a bisection search-based method, successive convex approximation, and difference of convex programming to develop a computationally efficient algorithm, which converges to a locally optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and show that the proposed SR techniques are able to achieve a lower BER than benchmark schemes.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the passive beamforming and information transfer (PBIT) technique for the large intelligent surface (LIS) aided multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MuMIMO) systems, where the LIS is deployed to enhance the primary communication via passive beamforming and simultaneously deliver its private data via spatial modulation. For the passive beamforming design, we propose to maximize the sum channel capacity of the LIS-aided Mu-MIMO systems and formulate the maximization problem as a two-step stochastic program. An efficient sample average approximation based iterative algorithm is developed for the passive beamforming design. For the receiver design, the signal detection at the receiver is a bilinear estimation problem since the LIS data are multiplicatively modulated onto the reflected signals of the reflecting elements. To solve this problem, we develop a turbo message passing algorithm in which the bilinear estimation problem is divided into two subproblems: one for the estimation of the user signals and the other for the estimation of the LIS data. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the advantages of our passive beamforming and receiver designs.},

In particular, we study the bistatic backscatter communication (BackCom) system assisted by an IRS. The phase shifts at the IRS are optimized jointly with the transmit beamforming vector of the carrier emitter to minimize the transmit power consumption at the carrier emitter whilst guaranteeing a required BackCom performance. The unique channel characteristics arising from multiple reflections at the IRS render the optimization problem highly non-convex. Therefore, we jointly utilize the minorization-maximization algorithm and the semidefinite relaxation technique to present an approximate solution for the optimal IRS phase shift design. We also extend our analytical results to the monostatic BackCom system. Numerical results indicate that the introduction of the IRS brings about considerable reductions in transmit power, even with moderate IRS sizes, which can be translated to range increases over the non-IRS-assisted BackCom system.},

abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables radio-frequency (RF) powered backscatter devices (BDs) (e.g., sensors, tags) to modulate their information bits over ambient RF carriers in an over-the-air manner. This technology also called "modulation in the air", thus has emerged as a promising solution to achieve green communications for future Internet-of-Things. This paper studies an AmBC system by leveraging the ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulated signals in the air. We first model such AmBC system from a spread-spectrum communication perspective, upon which a novel joint design for BD waveform and receiver detector is proposed. The BD symbol period is designed to be in general an integer multiplication of the OFDM symbol period, and the waveform for BD bit '0' maintains the same state within a BD symbol period, while the waveform for BD bit '1' has a state transition in the middle of each OFDM symbol period within a BD symbol period. In the receiver detector design, we construct the test statistic that cancels out the direct-link interference by exploiting the repeating structure of the ambient OFDM signals due to the use of cyclic prefix. For the system with a single-antenna receiver, the maximum-likelihood detector is proposed to recover the BD bits, for which the optimal threshold is obtained in closed-form expression. For the system with a multi-antenna receiver, we propose a new test statistic which is a linear combination of the per-antenna test statistics, and derive the corresponding optimal detector. The proposed optimal detectors require only knowing the strength of the backscatter channel, thus simplifying their implementation. Moreover, practical timing synchronization algorithms are proposed for the proposed AmBC system, and we also analyze the effect of various system parameters on the transmission rate and detection performance. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to verify that the proposed transceiver design can improve the system bit-error-rate (BER) performance and the operating range significantly, and achieve much higher data rate, as compared to the conventional design.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new technology for achieving both spectrum and energy efficient wireless communication systems in the future. However, existing works on IRS mainly consider frequency-flat channels and assume perfect knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. Motivated by this, in this paper we study an IRS-enhanced orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under frequency-selective channels and propose a practical transmission protocol with channel estimation. First, to reduce the overhead in channel training and estimation and to exploit the channel spatial correlation, we propose a novel IRS elements grouping method, where each group consists of a set of adjacent IRS elements that share a common reflection coefficient. Based on this grouping method, we propose a practical transmission protocol where only the combined channel of each group needs to be estimated, thus substantially reducing the training overhead. Next, with any given grouping and estimated CSI, we formulate the problem to maximize the achievable rate by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation and the IRS passive array reflection coefficients. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution for it, by alternately optimizing the power allocation and the passive array coefficients in an iterative manner, along with a customized method for the initialization. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly improves the OFDM link rate performance as compared to the case without using IRS. Moreover, it is shown that there exists an optimal size for IRS elements grouping which achieves the maximum achievable rate due to the trade-off between the training overhead and IRS passive beamforming flexibility.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) that enables the control of wireless propagation environment has recently emerged as a promising cost-effective technology for boosting the spectrum and energy efficiency in future wireless communication systems. Prior works on IRS are mainly based on the ideal phase shift model assuming the full signal reflection by each of the elements regardless of its phase shift, which, however, is practically difficult to realize. In contrast, we propose in this paper the practical phase shift model that captures the phase-dependent amplitude variation in the element-wise reflection coefficient. Based on the proposed model and considering an IRS-aided multiuser system with an IRS deployed to assist in the downlink communications from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna users, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total transmit power at the AP by jointly designing the AP transmit beamforming and the IRS reflect beamforming, subject to the users' individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. Iterative algorithms are proposed to find suboptimal solutions to this problem efficiently by utilizing the alternating optimization (AO) or penalty-based optimization technique. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance loss of the IRS-aided system that employs practical phase shifters but assumes the ideal phase shift model for beamforming optimization, as the number of IRS elements goes to infinity. Simulation results unveil substantial performance gains achieved by the proposed beamforming optimization based on the practical phase shift model as compared to the conventional ideal model.},

In this scenario, it is assumed that some users are able to harvest power from radio frequency (RF) signals to recharge batteries through wireless power transfer from the transmitter, while others are served simultaneously with data transmission. The criterion driving the optimization and design of the system is based on the weighted sum rate for the users being served with data. At the same time, constraints stating minimum per-user harvested powers are included in the optimization problem. This paper derives the structure of the optimal transmit covariance matrices in the case where both types of users are present simultaneously in the network, particularizing the results to the cases where either only harvesting nodes or only information users are to be served. The trade-off between the achieved weighted sum rate and the powers harvested by the user terminals is analyzed and evaluated using the rate-power (R-P) region. Finally, we propose a two-stage user grouping mechanism that decides which users should be scheduled to receive information and which users should be configured to harvest energy from the RF signals in each particular scheduling period, this being one of the main contributions of this paper.},

abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in a symbiotic radio (SR) system, in which a passive full-duplex backscatter device (BD) is parasitic in an active primary transmission. The primary transmitter (PT) with multiple antennas is designed to broadcast common messages to the primary receiver (PR) and the BD, as well as to support passive information transmission from the BD to the PR. To do so, the full-duplex BD absorbs a fraction of the incident signal from the PT to decode the common messages and simultaneously transmits its own information to the PR by backscattering the remaining part of the incident signal. We derive the achievable rates of the BD transmission with Gaussian and quadrature amplitude modulation codewords. We also formulate a transmit power minimization problem by jointly designing the beamforming vector at the PT and the power splitting factor at the BD. This problem is first solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique together with a one-dimensional linear exhaustive search over the power splitting factor. Then, a suboptimal but low-complexity solution with closed-form expressions is proposed. The simulation results have shown that the proposed suboptimal solution achieves almost the same performance as that obtained by the exhaustive search. In addition, our proposed SR system with the full-duplex BD outperforms the half-duplex system with the time-division-multiplexing mode in general.},

How to reliably transmit information in a RIS-based communication system arouses much interest. This paper proposes a reflecting modulation (RM) scheme for RIS-based communications, where both the reflecting patterns and transmit signals can carry information. Depending on that the transmitter and RIS jointly or independently deliver information, RM is further classified into two categories: jointly mapped RM (JRM) and separately mapped RM (SRM). JRM and SRM are naturally superior to existing schemes, because the transmit signal vectors, reflecting patterns, and bit mapping methods of JRM and SRM are more flexibly designed. To enhance transmission reliability, this paper proposes a discrete optimization-based joint signal mapping, shaping, and reflecting (DJMSR) design for JRM and SRM to minimize the bit error rate (BER) with a given transmit signal candidate set and a given reflecting pattern candidate set. To further improve the performance, this paper optimizes multiple reflecting patterns and their associated transmit signal sets in continuous fields for JRM and SRM. Numerical results show that JRM and SRM with the proposed system optimization methods considerably outperform existing schemes in BER.},

In this paper, we study the computation of multiple linear functions of Gaussian sources over-the-air using antenna arrays at both the IoT devices and the IoT access point (AP). The key challenges in this paper are the intranode interference of multiple functions, the nonuniform fading between different IoT devices and the massive channel state information (CSI) required at the IoT AP. We propose a novel transmitter design at the IoT devices with zero-forcing beamforming to cancel the intranode interference and uniform-forcing power control to compensate the nonuniform fading.

abstract = {One of the key enablers of future wireless communications is constituted by massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which can improve the spectral efficiency by orders of magnitude. In existing massive MIMO systems, however, conventional phased arrays are used for beamforming. This method results in excessive power consumption and high hardware costs. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been considered as one of the revolutionary technologies to enable energy-efficient and smart wireless communications, which is a two-dimensional structure with a large number of passive elements. In this paper, we develop a new type of high-gain yet low-cost RIS that bears 256 elements. The proposed RIS combines the functions of phase shift and radiation together on an electromagnetic surface, where positive intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes are used to realize 2-bit phase shifting for beamforming. This radical design forms the basis for the world's first wireless communication prototype using RIS having 256 two-bit elements. The prototype consists of modular hardware and flexible software that encompass the following: the hosts for parameter setting and data exchange, the universal software radio peripherals (USRPs) for baseband and radio frequency (RF) signal processing, as well as the RIS for signal transmission and reception. Our performance evaluation confirms the feasibility and efficiency of RISs in wireless communications. We show that, at 2.3 GHz, the proposed RIS can achieve a 21.7 dBi antenna gain. At the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency, that is, 28.5 GHz, it attains a 19.1 dBi antenna gain. Furthermore, it has been shown that the RIS-based wireless communication prototype developed is capable of significantly reducing the power consumption.},

FSS is a periodic surface with identical two-dimensional arrays of elements arranged on a dielectric substrate. An incoming plane wave will either be transmitted (passband) or reflected back (stopband), completely or partially, depending on the nature of array element. This occurs when the frequency of electromagnetic (EM) wave matches with the resonant frequency of the FSS elements. Therefore, an FSS is capable of passing or blocking the EM waves of certain range of frequencies in the free space; consequently, identified as spatial filters. Nowadays, FSSs have been studied comprehensively and huge growth is perceived in the field of its designing and implementation for different practical applications at frequency ranges of microwave to optical.

abstract = {Sensor collision (interference) is studied in a large network of low bit-rate sensors that communicate via backscatter, i.e. modulate the reflection of a common carrier transmitted by a central reader. Closed-form analysis is provided, quantifying sensor collision (interference) in high-density, backscatter sensor networks (BSN), as a function of number of tags and aggregate bandwidth. Analysis is applicable to a broad class of sensor subcarrier modulations, propagation environments and reader antenna directivity patterns. It is discovered that anti-collision performance in high-density backscatter sensor networks is feasible provided that appropriate modulation is used at each sensor. That is due to the round-trip nature of backscatter communication as well as the extended target range, which both impose stringent requirements on spectrum efficiency, not easily met by all modulations. Furthermore, aggregate bandwidth savings for given anti-collision performance are quantified, when simple division techniques on subcarrier (modulating) frequency and space (via moderately directive hub antenna) are combined. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {An intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can adaptively adjust the phase shifts of its reflecting units to strengthen the desired signal and/or suppress the undesired signal. In this letter, we investigate an IRS-aided secure wireless communication system where a multi-antenna access point (AP) sends confidential messages to a single-antenna user in the presence of a single-antenna eavesdropper. In particular, we consider the challenging scenario where the eavesdropping channel is stronger than the legitimate communication channel and they are also highly correlated in space. We maximize the secrecy rate of the legitimate communication link by jointly designing the AP's transmit beamforming and the IRS's reflect beamforming. While the resultant optimization problem is difficult to solve, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain high-quality suboptimal solution for it by applying the alternating optimization, and semidefinite relaxation methods. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly improves the secrecy communication rate for the considered setup over the case without using the IRS, and outperforms a heuristic scheme.},

abstract = {Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is a new frequency domain non-orthogonal multiple-access technique which can improve spectral efficiency of wireless radio access. With SCMA, different incoming data streams are directly mapped to codewords of different multi-dimensional cookbooks, where each codeword represents a spread transmission layer. Multiple SCMA layers share the same time-frequency resources of OFDMA. The sparsity of codewords makes the near-optimal detection feasible through iterative message passing algorithm (MPA). Such low complexity of multi-layer detection allows excessive codeword overloading in which the dimension of multiplexed layers exceeds the dimension of codewords. Optimization of overloading factor along with modulation-coding levels of layers provides a more flexible and efficient link-adaptation mechanism. On the other hand, the signal spreading feature of SCMA can improve link-adaptation as a result of less colored interference. In this paper a technique is developed to enable multi-user SCMA (MU-SCMA) for downlink wireless access. User pairing, power sharing, rate adjustment, and scheduling algorithms are designed to improve the downlink throughput of a heavily loaded network. The advantage of SCMA spreading for lightly loaded networks is also evaluated.},

abstract = {In this paper, a design method for the co-design and integration of a CMOS rectifier and small loop antenna is described. In order to improve the sensitivity, the antenna-rectifier interface is analyzed as it plays a crucial role in the co-design optimization. Subsequently, a 5-stage cross-connected differential rectifier with a 7-bit binary-weighted capacitor bank is designed and fabricated in standard 90 nm CMOS technology. The rectifier is brought at resonance with a high-Q loop antenna by means of a control loop that compensates for any variation at the antenna-rectifier interface and passively boosts the antenna voltage to enhance the sensitivity. A complementary MOS diode is proposed to improve the harvester's ability to store and hold energy over a long period of time during which there is insufficient power for rectification. The chip is ESD protected and integrated on a compact loop antenna. Measurements in an anechoic chamber at 868 MHz demonstrate a-27 dBm sensitivity for 1 V output across a capacitive load and 27 meter range for a 1.78 W RF source in an office corridor.

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of achieving max-min fairness amongst multiple co-channel multicast groups through transmit beamforming. We explicitly focus on overloaded scenarios in which the number of transmitting antennas is insufficient to neutralize all inter-group interference. Such scenarios are becoming increasingly relevant in the light of growing lowlatency content delivery demands, and also commonly appear in multibeam satellite systems. We derive performance limits of classical beamforming strategies using DoF analysis unveiling their limitations; for example, rates saturate in overloaded scenarios due to inter-group interference. To tackle interference, we propose a strategy based on degraded beamforming and successive interference cancellation. While the degraded strategy resolves the rate-saturation issue, this comes at a price of sacrificing all spatial multiplexing gains. This motivates the development of a unifying strategy that combines the benefits of the two previous strategies. We propose a beamforming strategy based on rate-splitting (RS) which divides the messages intended to each group into a degraded part and a designated part, and transmits a superposition of both degraded and designated beamformed streams. The superiority of the proposed strategy is demonstrated through DoF analysis. Finally, we solve the RS beamforming design problem and demonstrate significant performance gains through simulations.},

In addition, we consider a practical IRS assumption, in which the passive elements can only shift the incident signal to discrete phase levels. This non-convex problem is firstly decoupled via Lagrangian dual transform, and then the active and passive beamforming can be optimized alternatingly. The active beamforming at BS is optimized based on the fractional programming method. Then, three efficient algorithms with closed-form expressions are proposed for the passive beamforming at IRS.

abstract = {In this paper, a new spectrum sharing model referred to as riding on the primary (ROP) is proposed for wireless-powered IoT devices with ambient backscatter communication capabilities. The key idea of ROP is that the secondary transmitter harvests energy from the primary signal, then modulates its information bits to the primary signal, and reflects the modulated signal to the secondary receiver without violating the primary system's interference requirement. Compared with the conventional spectrum sharing model, the secondary system in the proposed ROP not only utilizes the spectrum of the primary system but also takes advantage of the primary signal to harvest energy and to carry its information. In this paper, we investigate the performance of such a spectrum sharing system under fading channels. To be specific, we maximize the ergodic capacity of the secondary system by jointly optimizing the transmit power of the primary signal and the reflection coefficient of the secondary ambient backscatter. Different (ideal/practical) energy consumption models, different (peak/average) transmit power constraints, different types (fixed/dynamically adjustable) reflection coefficient, different primary system's interference requirements (rate/outage) are considered. Optimal power allocation and reflection coefficient are obtained for each scenario.},

Those waveforms have been designed, assuming perfect channel state information at the transmitter. This paper proposes two waveform strategies relying on limited feedback for multi-antenna multi-sine WPT over frequency-selective channels. In the waveform selection strategy, the energy transmitter (ET) transmits over multiple timeslots with every time a different waveform precoder within a codebook, and the energy receiver (ER) reports the index of the precoder in the codebook that leads to the largest harvested energy. In the waveform refinement strategy, the ET sequentially transmits two waveforms in each stage, and the ER reports one feedback bit indicating an increase/decrease in the harvested energy during this stage. Based on multiple one-bit feedback, the ET successively refines waveform precoders in a tree-structured codebook over multiple stages. By employing the framework of the generalized Lloyd's algorithm, novel algorithms are proposed for both strategies to optimize the codebooks in both space and frequency domains. The proposed limited feedback-based waveform strategies are shown to outperform a set of baselines, achieving higher harvested energy.},

The retumn loss measured in this way allows us to calculate the backscattered power and to find the tag's RCS. Measurements were performed using an RFID tag operating in the UHF band. To determine whether the tag was turned on, we used an RFID tag tester. The tag's RCS was also alculated theoretically, using electromagnetic simulation software. The theoretical results were found to be in good agreement with experimental data.},

abstract = {By defining mutual information as a maximum over an appropriate space, channel capacities can be defined as double maxima and rate-distortion functions as double minima. This approach yields valuable new insights regarding the computation of channel capacities and rate-distortion functions. In particular, it suggests a simple algorithm for computing channel capacity that consists of a mapping from the set of channel input probability vectors into itself such that the sequence of probability vectors generated by successive applications of the mapping converges to the vector that achieves the capacity of the given channel. Analogous algorithms then are provided for computing rate-distortion functions and constrained channel capacities. The algorithms apply both to discrete and to continuous alphabet channels or sources. In addition, a formalization of the theory of channel capacity in the presence of constraints is included. Among the examples is the calculation of close upper and lower bounds to the rate-distortion function of a binary symmetric Markov source. {\textcopyright} 1972, IEEE. All rights reserved.},

One open problem for ambient backscatter is channel capacity. In this paper, we investigate the capacity problem of an ambient backscatter communication system with a passive tag and a reader. Based on the Gaussian channel model, we design a method to determine channel capacity for the ambient backscatter communication system. The channel capacity is the maximal value of the derived mutual information. Interestingly, we find that the capacity for the ambient backscatter communication system is obtained when the input signals are not equiprobable. Finally, numerical results are provided to corroborate our theoretical analysis.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising solution to enhance the wireless communication capacity both cost-effectively and energy-efficiently, by properly altering the signal propagation via tuning a large number of passive reflecting units. In this paper, we aim to characterize the fundamental capacity limit of IRS-aided point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with multi-antenna transmitter and receiver in general, by jointly optimizing the IRS reflection coefficients and the MIMO transmit covariance matrix. First, we consider narrowband transmission under frequency-flat fading channels, and develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to find a locally optimal solution by iteratively optimizing the transmit covariance matrix or one of the reflection coefficients with the others being fixed. Next, we consider capacity maximization for broadband transmission in a general MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under frequency-selective fading channels, where transmit covariance matrices can be optimized for different subcarriers while only one common set of IRS reflection coefficients can be designed to cater to all subcarriers. To tackle this more challenging problem, we propose a new alternating optimization algorithm based on convex relaxation to find a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve substantially increased capacity compared to traditional MIMO channels without the IRS, and also outperform various benchmark schemes. In particular, it is shown that with the proposed algorithms, various key parameters of the IRS-aided MIMO channel such as channel total power, rank, and condition number can be significantly improved for capacity enhancement.},

abstract = {Transmission through reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which control the reflection/scattering characteristics of incident waves in a deliberate manner to enhance the signal quality at the receiver, appears as a promising candidate for future wireless communication systems. In this paper, we bring the concept of RIS-assisted communications to the realm of index modulation (IM) by proposing RIS-space shift keying (RIS-SSK) and RIS-spatial modulation (RIS-SM) schemes. These two schemes are realized through not only intelligent reflection of the incoming signals to improve the reception but also utilization of the IM principle for the indices of multiple receive antennas in a clever way to improve the spectral efficiency. Maximum energy-based suboptimal (greedy) and exhaustive search-based optimal (maximum likelihood) detectors of the proposed RIS-SSK/SM schemes are formulated and a unified framework is presented for the derivation of their theoretical average bit error probability. Extensive computer simulation results are provided to assess the potential of RIS-assisted IM schemes as well as to verify our theoretical derivations. Our findings also reveal that RIS-based IM, which enables high data rates with remarkably low error rates, can become a potential candidate for future wireless communication systems in the context of beyond multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) solutions.},

To overcome this problem, energy harvesting offers a viable alternative to autonomously power IoT devices, resulting in a number of battery-less energy harvesting IoTs (or EH-IoTs) appearing in the market in recent years. Standards activities are also underway, which involve wireless protocol design suitable for EH-IoTs as well as testing procedures for various energy harvesting methods. Despite the early commercial and standards activities, IoT sensing, computing and communications under unpredictable power supply still face significant research challenges. This paper systematically surveys recent advances in EH-IoTs from several perspectives. First, it reviews the recent commercial developments for EH-IoT in terms of both products and services, followed by initial standards activities in this space. Then it surveys methods that enable the use of energy harvesting hardware as a proxy for conventional sensors to detect contexts in energy efficient manner. Next it reviews the advancements in efficient checkpointing and timekeeping for intermittently powered IoT devices. We also survey recent research in novel wireless communication techniques for EH-IoTs, such as the applications of reinforcement learning to optimize power allocations on-the-fly under unpredictable energy productions, and packet-less IoT communications and backscatter communication techniques for energy impoverished environments.

To maximize the system throughput and ensure fairness, we aim to maximize the minimum throughput among all BDs by jointly optimizing the backscatter time and reflection coefficients of the BDs, and the FAP's subcarrier power allocation, subject to the LU's throughput constraint, the BDs' harvested-energy constraints, and other practical constraints. However, the formulated problem is non-trivial to solve in general, since the variables are mutually coupled and result in non-convex constraints. We thus propose an iterative algorithm by leveraging the block coordinated decent and successive convex optimization techniques. We further show the convergence performances of the proposed algorithm and analyze its complexity. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed joint design achieves significant throughput gain as compared to the benchmark schemes.},

We investigate the beamforming design optimization problem which maximizes the sum capacity of primary and secondary transmissions under the capacity constraint of secondary transmission. In the MIMO SR backscatter system, each antenna of the SR BD reflects its received ambient radio frequency signals from all the transmitting antennas of the transmitter, which causes that the globally optimal solution is difficult to obtain. Here, we derive an algorithm to obtain the capacity upper bound. Furthermore, considering both primary and secondary transmissions, we propose an exact penalty method based locally optimal solution. Simulation results display that the proposed exact penalty method based locally optimal solution achieves the sum capacity which is close to the upper bound.},

Contrary to the conventional linear precoding (NoRS) that relies on fully treating any residual interference as noise, we consider a novel multigroup multicast beamforming strategy based on RSMA. RSMA relies on linearly precoded Rate-Splitting (RS) at the transmitter and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receivers, and has recently been shown to enable a flexible framework for non-orthogonal transmission and robust interference management in multi-antenna wireless networks. In this work, we characterize the MMF Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) achieved by RS and NoRS in multigroup multicast with imperfect CSIT and demonstrate the benefits of RS strategies for both underloaded and overloaded scenarios. Motivated by the DoF analysis, we then formulate a generic transmit power constrained optimization problem to achieve MMF rate performance. The superiority of RS-based multigroup multicast beamforming compared with NoRS is demonstrated via simulations in both terrestrial and multibeam satellite systems. In particular, due to the characteristics and challenges of multibeam satellite communications, our proposed RS strategy is shown promising to manage its inter-beam interference.},

TOPS can be used with arbitrary shaped one-dimensional (1-D) or two-dimensional (2-D) arrays. Unlike other coherent wideband methods, such as the coherent signal subspace method (CSSM) and WAVES, the new method does not require any preprocessing for initial values. The performance of those wideband techniques and incoherent MUSIC is compared with that of the new method through computer simulations. The simulations show that this new technique performs better than others in mid signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges, while coherent methods work best in low SNR and incoherent methods work best in high SNR.

abstract = {The driving force behind this work is the desire to obtain one method for estimating the ergodic capacity of lognormal (LN) channels for both Shannon capacity and constrained capacity. In recent years, researchers have determined methods for calculating the ergodic Shannon capacity for LN channels. However, in practical communication systems, the input signal is constrained to a discrete signaling set such as finite-size quadrature amplitude modulation constellations. At a high SNR, the Shannon capacity greatly overestimates the capacity of these practical systems, particularly for low-order constellations. For this reason, a method is needed to evaluate the capacity and outage probability for LN channels when the signal set is constrained to a finite alphabet. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a simple but accurate method for calculating both the ergodic Shannon capacity and the ergodic constrained capacity of practical signals for LN channels. This method also facilitates straightforward computation of outage probability and outage capacity. Prior to this work, the ergodic constrained capacity, outage probability, and outage capacity of practical signals for LN channels had not been dealt with in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Since the MIMO BC is in general a nondegraded BC, its capacity region remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we establish a duality between what is termed the "dirty paper" achievable region (the Caire-Shamai achievable region) for the MIMO BC and the capacity region of the MIMO multiple-access channel (MAC), which is easy to compute. Using this duality, we greatly reduce the computational complexity required for obtaining the dirty paper achievable region for the MIMO BC. We also show that the dirty paper achievable region achieves the sum-rate capacity of the MIMO BC by establishing that the maximum sum rate of this region equals an upper bound on the sum rate of the MIMO BC.},

abstract = {In this paper, a detection scheme for the uplink transmission of Wi-Fi backscatter system is proposed. In the uplink transmission, a backscatter tag modulates signals from a Wi-Fi access point by backscattering. Since the reflection occurs, the backscattered signal experiences more attenuation than the direct Wi-Fi signals to a Wi-Fi reader. Most recent studies focus on effective detection techniques to increase the coverage of the backscatter tag in the poor signal to interference plus noise ratio environment. This paper proposes an improved detection scheme using multiple antennas at the reader. At the reader, the backscattered signals are received by multiple antennas and thresholds are determined appropriately for improvement of detection performance. Typically the methods using multiple antennas require channel information. However the channel estimation for the uplink of backscatter system is difficult since the backscattered signals are weak. The detection method of this paper does not require the channel information for the uplink. Simulation results show improved performance and possibility for the increase of coverage.},

Existing AB systems adopt two-state amplitude shift keying or phase shift keying (PSK), where data are transmitted at the rate of one bit per symbol period. To increase the data rate, we investigate the high-order modulation where M -PSK is employed for backscattering. We derive the optimal multilevel energy detector and compute the closed-form symbol error rate. To show the realizability of the proposed design, we build a 4PSK-AB hardware prototype, in which the selection of load impedance is discussed with the aid of phasor diagram illustration. The hardware prototype can achieve the date rate of 20 kb/s. Besides, higher date rate is achievable for 98.7% of the time compared with binary AB communications, and the mean number of distinguishable symbols is 3.66.},

abstract = {A backscatter cooperation (BC) mechanism is pro-posed for power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink transmission. The key idea is to enable one user to split and then backscatter part of its received signals to improve the reception at another user. To evaluate its performance, three benchmark schemes are introduced. They are non-cooperation (NC)-NOMA, conventional relaying (CR)-NOMA, and incremental relaying (IR)-NOMA. For all these schemes, the analytical expressions of the minimum total power to avoid information outage are derived, based on which their respective outage performance, expected rates, and diversity-multiplexing trade-off (DMT) are investigated. Analytical results show that the proposed BC-NOMA strictly outperforms NC-NOMA in terms of all the three metrics. Furthermore, theoretical analyses are validated via Monte-Carlo simulations. It is shown that compared with CR/IR-NOMA, only the proposed BC-NOMA scheme can enhance the transmission reliability without impairing the transmission rate.},

abstract = {The ever-increasing number of IoT devices in our surrounding environment bring us tremendous amount of opportunities but also challenges including limited battery life, low computational capability and scalability of multiple access. Recent advances in backscatter communication have enabled ubiquitous IoT devices to communicate in a cost-and power-efficient way. However, most of the proposed backscatter solutions nowadays focus on the single tag paradigm, i.e., multiple tags do not transmit simultaneously and thus the solutions have difficulties to scale with a large number of tags. This work presents CBMA, a backscatter system that enables multiple concurrent backscatter tags to communicate reliably and efficiently. For the first time, we demonstrate that multiple tags can backscatter concurrently and efficiently with novel impedance-based power control at the tag, and can be successfully decoded with commodity WiFi devices without affecting the existing WiFi communication. We present the design details of CBMA and build a prototype with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and FPGA. The CBMA system achieves a 10-tag bit rate of 8Mbps while supporting a communication distance up to 10m. Compared to single-tag solutions, CBMA improves the backscatter throughput by more than 10× even in challenging indoor scenarios with rich multipath and interference.},

A non-orthogonal-multiple-access enhanced dynamic-time-division-multiple-access (NOMA-DTDMA) transmission scheme is proposed to exploit the channel dynamics and further improve the spectrum efficiency. In order to maximize the throughput performance and ensure BD fairness, we maximize the minimum throughput among all BDs by jointly optimizing the FAP's subcarrier power allocation, the BDs' backscatter time allocation and power reflection coefficients, subject to the LU's throughput requirement, the BDs' harvested energy requirements, and other practical constraints. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated non-convex problem, by utilizing the block coordinated descent and successive convex optimization techniques. The convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithm are also analyzed. Numerical results show that the proposed NOMA-DTDMA scheme significantly outperforms the benchmark scheme of dynamic TDMA in terms of both throughput performance and BD fairness. Also, the trade-off performances between the BDs' throughput and the LU's throughput requirement as well as the BDs' harvested energy requirements are numerically verified.},

abstract = {When simultaneous wireless information and power transfer is carried out, a fundamental tradeoff between achievable rate and harvested energy exists because the received power is used for two different purposes. The tradeoff is well characterized by the rate-energy region, and several techniques have been proposed to improve the achievable rate-energy region. However, the existing techniques still have a considerable loss in either energy or rate and thus the known achievable rate-energy regions are far from the ideal one. Deriving tight upper and lower bounds on the rate-energy region of our proposed scheme, we prove that the rate-energy region can be expanded almost to the ideal upper bound. Contrary to the existing techniques, in the proposed scheme, the information decoding circuit not only extracts amplitude and phase information but also combines the extracted information with the amplitude information obtained from the rectified signal. Consequently, the required energy for decoding can be minimized, and thus the proposed scheme achieves a near-optimal rate-energy region, which implies that the fundamental tradeoff in the achievable rate-energy region is nearly eliminated. To practically account for the theoretically achievable rate-energy region, we also present practical examples with an M -ary multi-level circular QAM with Gaussian maximum likelihood detection.},

abstract = {This work offers both analog and digital tag modulation schemes and respective receiver designs, for ultra-low power, high performance, ambient backscatter communications. All proposed techniques are based on simple, but careful, switching frequency control at the tag, allowing for the easy frequency-domain multiple access. First, a digital modulation scheme is offered, namely pseudo-frequency shift keying, assuming illumination from constant envelope-modulated signals and a fully coherent detector is derived along with closed-form probability of error. A second digital modulation scheme is also offered, based on a frequency-shifted form of binary phase shift keying (S-BPSK), relaxing the constant-envelope requirement for the illuminator and an illumination-agnostic detector is derived. Based on S-BPSK, short packet error correction coding is utilized for ambient backscatter communication, for the first time in the literature. It is shown that the proposed coded scheme under modulated ambient signal illumination & wireless channel variation, offers tremendous performance gains, i.e., modulation of the ambient signal is helpful. Finally, a third, purely analog, modulation scheme is analyzed, based on FM remodulation principles. A low-cost tag is implemented, demonstrating tag-toreceiver ranges up to 26 meters outdoors, power consumption of 24 $\mu$Watts in continuous operation, able to be interrogated by any conventional frequency modulation (FM) receiver. The proposed techniques cover a large variety of omnipresent wireless industry systems, enabling universal ambient backscatter and relevant wireless information and power transfer (WIPT) applications.},

With the proposed architecture, we maximize the total harvested dc power at the ER, by jointly optimizing the transmit energy beamforming at the energy transmitter and the power splitting ratios at the ER. Numerical results show that our proposed design by exploiting the nonlinearity of EH significantly improves the harvested dc power at the ER, as compared to two conventional designs.},

abstract = {In intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted communication systems, the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is a crucial impediment for achieving the beamforming gain of IRS because of the considerable overhead required for channel estimation. Specifically, under the current beamforming design for IRS-assisted communications, KMN +KM channel coefficients should be estimated, where K, N and M denote the numbers of users, IRS reflecting elements, and antennas at the base station (BS), respectively. These numbers can be extremely large in practice considering the current trend of massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output), i.e., a large M, and massive connectivity, i.e., a large K. To accurately estimate such a large number of channel coefficients within a short time interval, we propose a novel three-phase pilot-based channel estimation framework in this paper for IRS-assisted uplink multiuser communications, in which the direct channels from the users to the BS, the IRS reflected channels of a typical user, and the IRS reflected channels of the other users are estimated in three consecutive phases, respectively. Under this framework, we analytically prove that a time duration consisting of K + N + max(K .. 1; d(K .. 1)N=Me) pilot symbols is sufficient for the BS to perfectly recover all the KMN + KM channel coefficients for the case without receiver noise at the BS. In contrast to the channel estimation for conventional uplink communications without IRS where the minimum channel estimation time is independent of the number of receive antennas at the BS, our result reveals the crucial role of massive MIMO in reducing the channel estimation time for IRS-assisted communications. Further, for the case with receiver noise, the user pilot sequences, IRS reflecting coefficients, and BS linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) channel estimators are characterized in closed-form, and the corresponding estimation mean-squared error (MSE) is quantified.},

However, only the phase electromagnetic response of the RISs can be flexibly manipulated in most cases, which significantly limits the transmission rate of RIS-based transmitters. In this paper, RIS-based quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission are designed to improve the communication rate of RIS-based transmitter. In addition, our proposed method of achieving RIS-based MIMO-QAM is proved to be robust with the discrete phase shift of the RIS. Furthermore, a prototype is implemented to perform real-Time RIS-based MIMO-QAM transmission over the air, which practically validates the proposed approach.},

Therefore, we elaborate on the key differences and similarities between RISs and relaying, and, notably, illustrate numerical results that highlight the spectral efficiency gains of RISs whose transverse size is large as compared with the wavelength of the radio wave. Finally, we discuss the key open issues that need to be addressed in order to unlock the potential of RISs, and, in particular, to unveil their ultimate performance limits and to optimize their deployment in future wireless networks.},

abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been regarded as a revolutionary and promising technology owing to its powerful feature of adaptively shaping wireless propagation environment. However, as a frequency-selective device, the RIS can only effectively provide tunable phase-shifts for signals within a certain frequency band. Thus, base-station (BS)-RIS-user association is an important issue to maximize the efficiency and ability of the RIS in cellular networks. In this paper, we consider a RIS-aided cellular network and aim to maximize the sum-rate of downlink transmissions by designing BS-RIS-user association as well as the active and passive beamforming of BSs and RIS, respectively. A dynamically successive access algorithm is developed to design the user association. During the dynamical access process, an iterative algorithm is proposed to alternatively obtain the active and passive beamforming. Finally, the optimal BS-RIS association is obtained by an exhaustive search method. Simulation results illustrate the significant performance improvement of the proposed BS-RIS-user association and beamforming design algorithm.},

abstract = {Nonlinear energy harvesters (EH) behave differently depending on the range of their input power. In the literature, different models have been proposed mainly for relatively small and large input power regimes of an EH. Due to the complexity of the proposed nonlinear models, obtaining analytical optimal or well performing signal designs have been extremely challenging. Relying on the proposed models in the literature, the learning problem of modulation design for simultaneous wireless information-power transfer (SWIPT) over a point-to-point link is studied. Joint optimization of the transmitter and the receiver is implemented using neural network (NN)-based autoencoders. The results reveal that for relatively small channel input powers, as the power demand increases at the receiver, one of the symbols is shot away from the origin while the remaining symbols approach zero amplitude. In the very extreme case of merely receiver power demand, the modulations are in the form of On-Off keying signalling with a low probability of the On signal. On the other side, for relatively large channel input powers, it is observed that as the receiver power demand increases, a number of symbols approach zero amplitude, whereas the others (more than one symbol) get equally high amplitudes but with different phases. In the extreme scenario of merely receiver power demand, the modulation resembles multiple On-Off keying signalling with different phases.},

abstract = {This paper formulates and solves optimization problems whose objective is to maximize the sum-Throughput of wireless sensor networks with radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) and backscatter communication. The paper proposes and analyzes three protocols for maximizing the sum-Throughput; namely, the time-division with downlink data decoding protocol, hybrid power splitting/data decoding protocol, and backscatter-enabled combination protocol. The time-division protocol optimizes a wireless powered communication network (WPCN) with a two-way communication link between the sensors and a hybrid access point. The hybrid protocol optimizes a WPCN with a power splitting downlink data decoding phase. The backscattered-enabled combination protocol optimizes a WPCN with a power splitting downlink data decoding phase and backscatter communication enabled sensors. Numerical results show that the hybrid and combination protocols deliver up to 14.5% and 30.5% increase in sum-Throughput, respectively, compared with the reference time-switching RF EH protocol in a dynamic environment. The findings are significant for the future widespread adoption of WPCN systems powered by RF energy sources in the real world by increasing the amount of harvested energy and system achievable data rate.},

In this paper, we propose an RIS-enhanced multiple-input single-output system with reflection pattern modulation (RPM) to achieve PBIT, where the joint active and passive beamforming is carefully designed by taking into account the communication outage probability. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average received signal power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the access point (AP) and passive beamforming at the RIS under the assumption that the RIS's state information is statistically known by the AP, and propose a high-quality suboptimal solution based on the alternating optimization technique. Moreover, a closed-form expression for the asymptotic outage probability of the proposed scheme in Rician fading is derived. The achievable rate of the proposed scheme is also investigated under the assumption that the transmitted symbols are drawn from a finite constellation. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and reveal the effect of various system parameters on the achievable rate. It is shown that the proposed scheme outperforms, in terms of achievable rate, the conventional RIS-assisted system without information transfer.},

In this study, we evaluate the performance of an LIS-assisted large-scale antenna system by formulating a tight approximation of the ergodic capacity and investigate the effect of the phase shifts on the ergodic capacity in different propagation scenarios. In particular, we propose an optimal phase shift design based on the ergodic capacity approximation and statistical channel state information. Furthermore, we derive the requirement on the quantization bits of the LIS to promise an acceptable capacity degradation. Numerical results show that using the proposed phase shift design can achieve the maximum ergodic capacity, and a 2-bit quantizer is sufficient to ensure capacity degradation of no more than 1 bit/s/Hz.},

abstract = {This two-part paper develops novel methodologies for using fractional programming (FP) techniques to design and optimize communication systems. Part I of this paper proposes a new quadratic transform for FP and treats its application for continuous optimization problems. In this Part II of the paper, we study discrete problems, such as those involving user scheduling, which are considerably more difficult to solve. Unlike the continuous problems, discrete or mixed discrete-continuous problems normally cannot be recast as convex problems. In contrast to the common heuristic of relaxing the discrete variables, this work reformulates the original problem in an FP form amenable to distributed combinatorial optimization. The paper illustrates this methodology by tackling the important and challenging problem of uplink coordinated multi-cell user scheduling in wireless cellular systems. Uplink scheduling is more challenging than downlink scheduling, because uplink user scheduling decisions significantly affect the interference pattern in nearby cells. Further, the discrete scheduling variable needs to be optimized jointly with continuous variables such as transmit power levels and beamformers. The main idea of the proposed FP approach is to decouple the interaction among the interfering links, thereby permitting a distributed and joint optimization of the discrete and continuous variables with provable convergence. The paper shows that the well-known weighted minimum meansquare-error (WMMSE) algorithm can also be derived from a particular use of FP; but our proposed FP-based method significantly outperforms WMMSE when discrete user scheduling variables are involved, both in term of run-time efficiency and optimizing results.},

Due to the coupling of optimization variables, this problem is a complex non-convex optimization problem, and it is challenging to solve it directly. We first transform the problem, and then apply the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm framework to divide the transformed problem into four blocks to solve it. Specifically, by applying successive convex approximation (SCA) and difference-convex (DC) programming, UAV trajectory, UAV transmission power allocation, PS ratio and IRS reflection coefficient are alternately optimized when the other three are given until convergence is achieved.

abstract = {Cognitive ambient backscatter communication is a novel spectrum sharing paradigm, in which the backscatter system shares not only the same spectrum, but also the same radio-frequency source with the legacy system. Conventional energy detector (ED) suffers from severe error floor problem due to the existence of co-channel direct link interference (DLI) from the legacy system. In this paper, novel error-floor-free detectors are proposed to tackle the DLI using multiple receive antennas at the reader. First, beamforming-assisted ED and likelihood-ratio-based detector are proposed for backscatter symbol detection when the reader has perfect channel state information (CSI). Then a novel statistical clustering framework is proposed for joint CSI feature learning and backscatter symbol detection. Extensive simulation results have shown that the proposed methods can significantly outperform the conventional ED. In addition, the proposed clustering-based methods perform comparably as their counterparts with perfect CSI.},

abstract = {Self-sustainable communications based on advanced energy harvesting technologies have been under rapid development, which facilitate autonomous operation and energy-efficient transmission. Recently, ambient backscattering that leverages existing RF signal resources in the air has been invented to empower data communication among low-power devices. In this paper, we introduce hybrid device-to-device (D2D) communications by integrating ambient backscattering and wireless-powered communications. The hybrid D2D communications are self-sustainable, as no dedicated external power supply is required. However, since the radio signals for energy harvesting and backscattering come from external RF sources, the performance of the hybrid D2D communications needs to be optimized efficiently. As such, we design two mode selection protocols for the hybrid D2D transmitter, allowing a more flexible adaptation to the environment. We then introduce analytical models to characterize the impacts of the considered environment factors, e.g., distribution, spatial density, and transmission load of the ambient transmitters, on the hybrid D2D communications performance. Extensive simulations show that the repulsion factor among the ambient transmitters has a non-trivial impact on the communication performance. Additionally, we reveal how different mode selection protocols affect the performance metrics.},

In that way, the transmitter for each sensor is simplified to a transistor connected to an antenna and therefore, the cost for each sensor's communicator becomes negligible, while energy used for wireless communication per sensor is minimized. A software-defined transceiver is built to transmit a carrier, receive the reflections from various sensors and extract their transmitted messages. This work presents a thorough model of the backscatter radio link, the system architecture and a set of data extraction techniques for each sensor's information, testing in practice a sensor communicating through backscatter at a range of approximately 15 meters indoors, with 5 milliwatt transmission power at 10 bits per second.

abstract = {A Cell-Free Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system comprises a very large number of distributed access points (APs), which simultaneously serve a much smaller number of users over the same time/frequency resources based on directly measured channel characteristics. The APs and users have only one antenna each. The APs acquire channel state information through time-division duplex operation and the reception of uplink pilot signals transmitted by the users. The APs perform multiplexing/de-multiplexing through conjugate beamforming on the downlink and matched filtering on the uplink. Closed-form expressions for individual user uplink and downlink throughputs lead to max-min power control algorithms. Max-min power control ensures uniformly good service throughout the area of coverage. A pilot assignment algorithm helps to mitigate the effects of pilot contamination, but power control is far more important in that regard. Cell-Free Massive MIMO has considerably improved performance with respect to a conventional small-cell scheme, whereby each user is served by a dedicated AP, in terms of both 95%-likely per-user throughput and immunity to shadow fading spatial correlation. Under uncorrelated shadow fading conditions, the cell-free scheme provides nearly fivefold improvement in 95%-likely per-user throughput over the small-cell scheme, and tenfold improvement when shadow fading is correlated.},

abstract = {Wireless communication environments are unaware of the ongoing data exchange efforts within them. Moreover, their effect on the communication quality is intractable in all but the simplest cases. The present work proposes a new paradigm, where indoor scattering becomes software-defined and, subsequently, optimizable across wide frequency ranges. Moreover, the controlled scattering can surpass natural behavior, exemplary overriding Snell's law, reflecting waves towards any custom angle (including negative ones). Thus, path loss and multi-path fading effects can be controlled and mitigated. The core technology of this new paradigm are metasurfaces, planar artificial structures whose effect on impinging electromagnetic waves is fully defined by their macro-structure. The present study contributes the software-programmable wireless environment model, consisting of several HyperSurface tiles controlled by a central, environment configuration server. HyperSurfaces are a novel class of metasurfaces whose structure and, hence, electromagnetic behavior can be altered and controlled via a software interface. Multiple networked tiles coat indoor objects, allowing fine-grained, customizable reflection, absorption or polarization overall. A central server calculates and deploys the optimal electromagnetic interaction per tile, to the benefit of communicating devices. Realistic simulations using full 3D ray-tracing demonstrate the groundbreaking potential of the proposed approach in 2.4GHz and 60GHz frequencies.},

In particular, we consider a three-node system with one transmitter that broadcasts a common signal to separated information decoding (ID) and EH receivers. Owing to the nonlinearity of the EH receiver circuit, the efficiency of wireless power transfer depends significantly on the waveform of the transmitted signal. In this paper, we aim to answer the following fundamental question: What is the optimal input distribution of the transmit waveform that maximizes the rate of the ID receiver for a given required harvested power at the EH receiver? In particular, we study the capacity of a SWIPT system impaired by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) under average-power (AP) and peak-power (PP) constraints at the transmitter and an EH constraint at the EH receiver. Using Hermite polynomial bases, we prove that the optimal capacityachieving input distribution that maximizes the rate-energy region is unique and discrete with a finite number of mass points. Our numerical results show that the rate-energy region is enlarged for a larger PP constraint and that the rate loss of the considered SWIPT system compared to the AWGN channel without EH receiver is reduced by increasing the AP budget.},

abstract = {Spectrum sensing is an essential technology to detect the presence of primary users' (PUs) signals in cognitive radio (CR) networks. To achieve desirable performances under shadowing and fading environments, cooperative spectrum sensing has been proposed as a promising scheme, which takes advantage of spatial and multiuser diversity gain. In this paper, we investigate cooperative sensing (CS) in a heterogeneous CR network scenario, where each secondary user (SU) may be equipped with different numbers of receive antennas and may have different signal processing capabilities, e.g., sampling rates. By considering the discrepancy in sensing reliability of different SUs, we propose an optimal normalized energy detection-based CS (NED-CS) scheme by virtue of the principle of log-likelihood ratio test (LRT). This LRT-based NED-CS scheme also takes into account the reporting errors at a fusion center (FC), which may receive erroneous results from some SUs due to channel fading and quantization errors. Our derivation shows that the detection statistic of our proposed LRT-based NED-CS scheme is the linear combination of modified local detection statistics, and the optimal combining coefficient can be shown to be a function of the numbers of antennas, the received signal samples, the received signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), and the variances of reporting errors at each SU. Meanwhile, to drop the prerequisite on a priori information on the received SNRs of all SUs and the variances of reporting errors and to simplify the decision making and threshold setting, a simplified LRT (SLRT)-based NED-CS scheme is proposed as well. Furthermore, we analyze and compare the performance of our proposed LRT-based NED-CS scheme with existing NED-CS schemes, including the equal gain combination (EGC) method and the maximum normalized energy (MNE) detector, with reporting errors under both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels in a heterogeneous CR network. We derive the probability density function (PDF) of received SNR at each SU and obtain the series expansions and closed-form approximate expressions of detection and false alarm probabilities of our proposed LRT-based NED-CS scheme. Our analytical results match simulation results well, and both of them show that the proposed LRT- and SLRT-based NED-CS schemes perform significantly better than the existing EGC and MNE methods.},

Instead of assuming Gaussian input distribution, the proposed study matches the practical ambient backscatter scenarios, where the input of the tag can only be binary. We derive the closed-form capacity expression as well as the capacity-achieving input distribution for the BIBO channel. To show the influence of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the capacity, a closed-form tight ceiling is also derived when SNR turns relatively large. For BISO and BIEO channel, we obtain the closed-form mutual information, while the semi-closed-form capacity value can be obtained via one dimensional searching. Simulations are provided to corroborate the theoretical studies. Interestingly, the simulations show that: (i) the detection threshold maximizing the capacity of BIBO channel is the same as the one from the maximum likelihood signal detection; (ii) the maximal of the mutual information of all channels is achieved almost by a uniform input distribution; and (iii) the mutual information of the BIEO channel is larger than that of the BIBO channel, but is smaller than that of the BISO channel.},

On the one hand, a reconfigurable intelligent surface improves the network performance by adding electronically controlled reflected paths in the radio propagation channel. On the other hand, in an ambient backscatter system, a device, named tag, communicates towards a reader by backscattering the waves of an ambient source (such as a TV tower). However, the tag's backscattered signal is weak and strongly interfered by the direct signal from the ambient source. In this paper, we propose a new reconfigurable intelligent surface assisted ambient backscatter system. The proposed surface allows to control the reflection of an incident wave coming from the exact source location towards the tag and reader locations (creating hot spots at their locations), thanks to passive reflected beams from a predefined codebook. A common phase-shift can also be applied to the beam. Thanks to these features, we demonstrate experimentally that the performance of ambient backscatter communications can be significantly improved.},

abstract = {We propose a new simultaneous wireless information and power transfer technique that embeds information bits in the tone index of multisine waveforms. By varying the number of subcarriers of the transmitted bandwidth-constrained multisine signal, the proposed scheme enables efficient radio-frequency energy harvesting and low-complexity information transmission. The receiver does not require channel estimation and employs a non-coherent maximum-likelihood detection at the envelope of the received signal. The performance of the proposed tone-index modulation is evaluated in terms of average error probability for a flat-fading channel, and we show that it outperforms its peak-to-average-power-ratio counterpart.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of the so-called Internet of Things is expected to significantly expand and support the deployment of resource-limited devices. Therefore, intelligent scheduling protocols and technologies such as wireless power transfer, are important for the efficient implementation of these massive low-powered networks. This paper studies the performance of a wireless powered communication network, where multiple batteryless devices harvest radio-frequency from a dedicated transmitter in order to communicate with a common information receiver (IR). We investigate several novel selection schemes, corresponding to different channel state information requirements and implementation complexities. In particular, each scheme schedules the $k$-th best device based on: a) the end-to-end (e2e) signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), b) the energy harvested at the devices, c) the uplink transmission to the IR, and d) the conventional/legacy max-min selection policy. We consider a non-linear energy harvesting (EH) model and derive analytical expressions for the outage probability of each selection scheme by using tools from high order statistics. %Our results show that, the performance of all the proposed schemes converges to an error floor due to the saturation effects of the considered EH model. Moreover, an asymptotic scenario in terms of the number of devices is considered and, by applying extreme value theory, the system's performance is evaluated. We derive a complete analytical framework that provides useful insights for the design and realization of such networks.},

abstract = {This paper presents a scalable uplink multiple access (SUMA) protocol for bistatic Wi-Fi backscatter systems, composed of a Wi-Fi reader, Wi-Fi helper, and multiple Wi-Fi backscatter tags. SUMA uses a Wi-Fi reader-initiated dynamic framed slotted ALOHA (DFSA)-based multiple access protocol to minimize collisions caused by simultaneous Wi-Fi backscatter uplink traffic from multiple Wi-Fi backscatter tags. In SUMA, the Wi-Fi helper first estimates the number of tags at the start of network operation and derives an appropriate slot-count parameter (i.e., $Q$ ), based on which the frame size is specified. Then, the Wi-Fi helper adaptively adjusts the value of $Q$ to maximize network performance while continuously monitoring the number of remaining Wi-Fi backscatter tags to detect information. An experimental simulation was performed to verify the superiority of SUMA. The results demonstrated that SUMA obtained higher performance in terms of the number of collided and empty slots, delay, and throughput compared with the legacy DFSA approach adopted in the EPCglobal Class 1 Gen 2 standard.},

In terms of practice, a concrete way to design and prototype a wireless, batteryless, RF-powered, reconfigurable surface is offered and a proof-of-concept is experimentally demonstrated. It is also found that even with perfect channel estimation, the weak nature of backscattered links limits the performance gains, even for large number of surface elements. Impact of channel estimation errors is also studied. Future extensions at various carrier frequencies could be directly accommodated, through simple modifications in the antenna and matching network of each RFID tag/surface element.},

abstract = {The use of multisine signals to improve the efficiency of wireless power transfer (WPT) for low average received power was proposed recently. Several measurement-based studies illustrated the gain that can be achieved for different circuit or waveform instances, focusing on the impact of a time-varying amplitude on the rectifying efficiency. This paper first establishes a model enabling a thorough analysis of the multisine-based WPT system focusing on the bandwidth of the signal and the rectifier. This model enables a codesign of signal and rectifier for optimal WPT. The proposed model provides insight into the output voltage and power, as a function of the input waveform for different circuit models. By including the input matching and the clamper, our model is generic and can include a wide range of rectifiers with different voltage multiplication approaches. The key insight gained from our analysis is that there is a tradeoff between the frequency spacing of the tones of the multisine signal and the cut-off frequency of the low-pass RC filter, as a main property of the rectifier circuit. Our model predicts the measured power conversion efficiency and voltage with an error below 0.1 and 0.2 V, respectively.},

abstract = {Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) is intended to supplant legacy (optical) bar code scanning technology found in many logistic and retail applications. RFID is distinguished by inexpensive, low power and compact form factor tags, whose longevity and efficacy are predicated on using passive communication techniques and on-tag power harvesting. Such tags employ backscatter modulation, which does not require any active RF components. As a result, backscatter has become an attractive design choice for short-range communications in power constrained wireless sensor networking scenarios. The purpose of this work is two-fold. First, it aims to expose backscatter communication as an emerging topic to a communication systems-theoretic audience. Since backscatter modulation and on-tag power harvesting efficiency are coupled, it is necessary to re-examine notions of power and spectral efficiency from an energy-constraint perspective; this leads to novel coded modulation schemes for future RFID systems. Further, we investigate RFID MIMO systems where the channel fading encountered has different statistics than the classical Rayleigh fading model. In turn,the trade off between diversity order and spatial multiplexing gains are distinct from wide-area MIMO. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of wireless applications, the electromagnetic (EM) space is becoming more and more crowded and complex. This makes it a challenging task to accommodate the growing number of radio systems with limited radio resources. In this paper, by considering the EM space as a radio ecosystem, and leveraging the analogy to the natural ecosystem in biology, a novel symbiotic communication (SC) paradigm is proposed through which the relevant radio systems, called symbiotic radios (SRs), in a radio ecosystem form a symbiotic relationship (e.g., mutualistic symbiosis) through intelligent resource/service exchange. Radio resources include, e.g., spectrum, energy, and infrastructure, while typical radio services are communicating, relaying, and computing. The symbiotic relationship can be realized via either symbiotic coevolution or symbiotic synthesis. In symbiotic coevolution, each SR is empowered with an evolutionary cycle alongside the multi-agent learning, while in symbiotic synthesis, the SRs ingeniously optimize their operating parameters and transmission protocols by solving a multi-objective optimization problem. Promisingly, the proposed SC paradigm breaks the boundary of radio systems, thus providing us a fresh perspective on radio resource management and new guidelines to design future wireless communication systems.},

Such networks will enable trillions of future low-power devices to sense, compute, connect, and energize anywhere, anytime, and on the move. The design of such future networks brings new challenges and opportunities for signal processing, machine learning, sensing, and computing so as to make the best use of the RF radiations, spectrum, and network infrastructure in providing cost-effective and real-time power supplies to wireless devices and enable wireless-powered applications. In this paper, we first review recent signal processing techniques to make WPT and wireless information and power transfer as efficient as possible. Topics include power amplifier and energy harvester nonlinearities, active and passive beamforming, intelligent reflecting surfaces, receive combining with multi-antenna harvester, modulation, coding, waveform, massive MIMO, channel acquisition, transmit diversity, multi-user power region characterization, coordinated multipoint, and distributed antenna systems. Then, we overview two different design methodologies: the model and optimize approach relying on analytical system models, modern convex optimization, and communication theory, and the learning approach based on data-driven end-to-end learning and physics-based learning. We discuss the pros and cons of each approach, especially when accounting for various nonlinearities in wireless-powered networks, and identify interesting emerging opportunities for the approaches to complement each other. Finally, we identify new emerging wireless technologies where WPT may play a key role -- wireless-powered mobile edge computing and wireless-powered sensing -- arguing WPT, communication, computation, and sensing must be jointly designed.},

RIS is envisioned to offer unprecedented spectral efficiency gains by utilizing $N$ passive reflecting elements that induce phase shifts on the impinging electromagnetic waves to smartly reconfigure the signal propagation environment. We study the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) achieved by the optimal linear precoder (OLP), that maximizes the minimum SINR subject to a given power constraint for any given RIS phase matrix, for the cases where the LoS channel matrix between the BS and the RIS is of rank-one and of full-rank. In the former scenario, the minimum SINR achieved by the RIS-assisted link is bounded by a quantity that goes to zero with $K$. For the high-rank scenario, we develop accurate deterministic approximations for the parameters of the asymptotically OLP, which are then utilized to optimize the RIS phase matrix. Simulation results show that RISs can outperform half-duplex relays with a small number of passive reflecting elements while large RISs are needed to outperform full-duplex relays.},

abstract = {As a revolutionary paradigm for controlling wireless channels, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a candidate technology for future 6G networks. However, due to the multiplicative fading effect, RISs only achieve a negligible capacity gain in many scenarios with strong direct links. In this paper, the concept of active RISs is proposed to overcome this fundamental limitation. Unlike the existing passive RISs that reflect signals without amplification, active RISs can amplify the reflected signals. We develop a signal model for active RISs, which is validated through experimental measurements. Based on this model, we formulate the sum-rate maximization problem for active RIS aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and a precoding algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Results show that, in a typical wireless system, the existing passive RISs can realize only a negligible sum-rate gain of 3\%, while the proposed active RISs can achieve a significant sum-rate gain of 108\%, thus overcoming the multiplicative fading effect.},

This survey presents an insightful understanding of 6G wireless communications by introducing requirements, features, critical technologies, challenges, and applications. First, we give an overview of 6G from perspectives of technologies, security and privacy, and applications. Subsequently, we introduce various 6G technologies and their existing challenges in detail, e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), intelligent surfaces, THz, space-air-ground-sea integrated network, cell-free massive MIMO, etc. Because of these technologies, 6G is expected to outperform existing wireless communication systems regarding the transmission rate, latency, global coverage, etc. Next, we discuss security and privacy techniques that can be applied to protect data in 6G. Since edge devices are expected to gain popularity soon, the vast amount of generated data and frequent data exchange make the leakage of data easily. Finally, we predict real-world applications built on the technologies and features of 6G; for example, smart healthcare, smart city, and smart manufacturing will be implemented by taking advantage of AI.},

After the description of the exact expression with an infinite series form, an approximation formula of SNR density with a simple monomial form is given utilizing Nakagami m approximation of Rician distribution. Through computer simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed formulae is verified, and the advantage of the approximated formula particular in case of large array size and/or large Rician factor is demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

In this correspondence, we consider a system consisting of a legacy modulated continuous carrier multiple-input-multiple-output link and a multiantenna modulated rescatter (MRS) node, where the MRS node modulates and rescatters the signal generated by the legacy transmitter. The receiver seeks to decode both the original message and the information added by the MRS. We show that the achievable sum rate of this system exceeds that which the legacy system could achieve alone. We further consider the impact of channel estimation errors under the least squares channel estimation and study the achievable rate of the legacy and MRS systems, where a linear minimum mean square error receiver with successive interference cancellation is utilized for joint decoding.},

We then discuss a few use cases of hybrid radio networks to suggest potential applications and to improve network performance. Furthermore, we consider a specific case in which hybrid radios act as passive relays to assist active RF communications.

abstract = {Simultaneous information and power transfer over the wireless channels potentially offers great convenience to mobile users. Yet practical receiver designs impose technical constraints on its hardware realization, as practical circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly. To make theoretical progress, we propose a general receiver operation, namely, dynamic power splitting (DPS), which splits the received signal with adjustable power ratio for energy harvesting and information decoding, separately. Three special cases of DPS, namely, time switching (TS), static power splitting (SPS) and on-off power splitting (OPS) are investigated. The TS and SPS schemes can be treated as special cases of OPS. Moreover, we propose two types of practical receiver architectures, namely, separated versus integrated information and energy receivers. The integrated receiver integrates the front-end components of the separated receiver, thus achieving a smaller form factor. The rate-energy tradeoff for the two architectures are characterized by a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. The optimal transmission strategy is derived to achieve different rate-energy tradeoffs. With receiver circuit power consumption taken into account, it is shown that the OPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. For the ideal case when the receiver circuit does not consume power, the SPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. In addition, we study the performance for the two types of receivers under a realistic system setup that employs practical modulation. Our results provide useful insights to the optimal practical receiver design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). {\textcopyright} 1972-2012 IEEE.},

In this paper, we consider a single BackCom system, where multiple BNs are served by a reader. We propose using the power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), i.e., multiplexing the BNs in different regions or with different backscattered power levels, to enhance the spectrum efficiency of the BackCom system. To better exploit power-domain NOMA, we propose setting the reflection coefficients for multiplexed BNs to be different. Based on this considered model, we develop the reflection coefficient selection criteria. To illustrate the enhanced system with the proposed criteria, we analyze the performance of the BackCom system in terms of the average number of bits that can be successfully decoded by the reader for the two-node pairing case and the average number of successful BNs for the general multiplexing case. Our results show that NOMA achieves the much better performance gain in the BackCom system as compared to its performance gain in the conventional system, which highlights the importance of applying NOMA to the BackCom system.},

Evaluating the performance and optimizing the deployment of RISs in wireless networks need physically sound frameworks that account for the actual characteristics of engineered metasurfaces. In this paper, we introduce a general macroscopic model for the realistic evaluation of RIS scattering, based on its decomposition into multiple scattering mechanisms and aimed at being embedded into ray models. Since state-of-the-art ray models can already efficiently simulate specular interactions (reflection, diffraction) and diffuse scattering, but not anomalous reradiation, we complement them with a Huygens principle approach and two possible implementations of it. The different scattering mechanisms are combined through a suitable power conservation equation. Notably, multiple reradiation modes can be modeled through the proposed approach. In addition, we validate the overall model's accuracy by benchmarking it against several case studies available in the literature, either based on analytical models, full-wave simulations, or experimental measurements.},

To avoid the need of the instantaneous information, including the specific codes and the instantaneous channel state information of the backscatter links, and to optimize the transmit power and the BD reflection coefficients, we derive the asymptotic BD signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) by employing the large-dimension random matrix theory. We formulate the joint optimization problem to maximize the minimum asymptotic SINR among BDs with guaranteeing the primary target rate.

Considering the nonlinearity of practical energy harvesting circuits, we adopt the realistic nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) model rather than the idealistic linear EH model. To characterize the optimal rate-energy (RE) tradeoff, we consider the problem of maximizing the R-E region, which is nonconvex. We solve this challenging problem for two different cases of the channel state information (CSI): (i) when the CSI is known only at the receiver (the CSIR case) and (ii) when the CSI is known at both the transmitter and the receiver (the CSI case). For these two cases, we develop the corresponding optimal dynamic power splitting schemes. To address the complexity issue, we also propose the suboptimal schemes with low complexities. Comparing the proposed schemes to the existing schemes, we provide various useful and interesting insights into the dynamic power splitting for the nonlinear EH. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the scenarios of the partial CSI at the transmitter and the harvested energy maximization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed schemes significantly outperform the existing schemes and the proposed suboptimal scheme works very close to the optimal scheme at a much lower complexity.},

As the modulator is usually the most power-hungry block in an RFID tag, this paper proposes a power-saving modulator. The proposed modulator uses phase shift keying (PSK) backscatter modulation which allows tag to communicate data from its memory to a reader by PSK modulation. The proposed modulator uses a MOSCAP as a variable impedance and is designed in a new one-inverter structure in compare to the conventional varactor-based modulators designed in two-inverter structure, as this modulator needs just a low voltage swing to drive its MOSCAP. Using MOSCAP as the variable capacitance leads to a low voltage design. Also, the fundamental equations required for determination of the capacitive impedance seen by the antenna is presented. This impedance is the master key in modulator design. The modulator has been designed, simulated and optimized in 0.18 $\mu$m CMOS technology. All possible simulation results are presented to approve its compatible operation with C1 G2 EPC global standard.

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has drawn a lot of attention recently as a promising new solution to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency for future wireless communication systems. By utilizing massive low-cost passive reflecting elements, the wireless propagation environment becomes controllable and thus can be made favorable for improving the communication performance. Prior works on IRS mainly rely on the instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI), which, however, is practically difficult to obtain for IRS-associated links due to its passive operation and large number of elements. To overcome this difficulty, we propose in this paper a new two-timescale (TTS) transmission protocol to maximize the achievable average sum-rate for an IRS-aided multiuser system under the general correlated Rician channel model. Specifically, the passive IRS phase-shifts are first optimized based on the statistical CSI (S-CSI) of all links, which varies much slowly as compared to their I-CSI, while the transmit beamforming/precoding vectors at the access point (AP) are then designed to cater to the I-CSI of the users' effective channels with the optimized IRS phase-shifts, thus significantly reducing the channel training overhead and passive beamforming complexity over the existing schemes based on the I-CSI of all channels. For the single-user case, a novel penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed, where the IRS phase-shifts are updated in parallel to reduce the computational time. For the multiuser case, we propose a general TTS optimization algorithm by constructing a quadratic surrogate of the objective function, which cannot be explicitly expressed in closed-form. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and evaluate the impact of S-CSI and channel correlation on the system performance.},

In such system, a radio frequency (RF) tag can transmit data to a receiver without battery and without generating any new RF wave, just by backscattering the incident RF wave originated by an ambient RF source. The simplest tag is a dipole that is either in an absorbing mode or in reflecting mode to send "0" or "1", and thus leads to a modulation order of 2. Previous solutions to reach higher modulation order, so as to achieve higher data rate, are based on antenna arrays. However, such solutions are not suitable for connected objects, due to their sizes. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a new tag that uses a compact antenna with reconfigurable radiation patterns to provide a high modulation order. We present experimental bit error rate measurements obtained with an experimental test-bed and two tag antennas, both providing 4 states and thus being able to convey 2 bits per symbol. These measurements show that the performance improves with increasing number of receive antennas, and lead to the conclusion that a tag antenna with low cross-correlations between reconfigurable radiation patterns is suitable for backscattering applications in IoT.},

By leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect the signals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS achieve a high passive beamforming gain, which is appealing for drastically enhancing the WPT efficiency and thereby the R-E trade-off of SWIPT systems. We consider an IRS being deployed to assist a multi-antenna access point (AP) to serve multiple information decoding receivers (IDRs) and energy harvesting receivers (EHRs). We aim to maximize the weighted sum-power received by EHRs via jointly optimizing the transmit precoders at the AP and reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for IDRs. Since this problem is non-convex, we propose efficient algorithms to obtain suboptimal solutions for it. In particular, we prove that it is sufficient to send information signals only at the AP to serve both IDRs and EHRs regardless of their channel realizations.

In this paper, we model a cooperative AmBC system from a spectrum- sharing perspective, where a cooperative receiver (C-RX) decodes the information from both a multi-antenna primary transmitter (PT) and a single-antenna secondary transmitter (i.e., tag). We consider two scenarios: first, the tag-symbol period equals the PT-symbol period; second, the tag-symbol period is an integer multiple of the PT-symbol period. For each scenario, we analyze the data rate via successive- interference-cancellation (SIC) based decoding, and formulate a problem to maximize the sum rate by optimizing the beamforming vector at the PT. The problems are transformed into semi-definite programming (SDP), and solved by using the technique of semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Furthermore, a novel transmit beamforming structure is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of beamforming optimization. Numerical results show that the cooperative AmBC system can achieve a higher sum rate than a conventional point-to-point system without a backscatter tag.},

However, its large scale adoption is strongly impeded by the limited energy available for most IoT devices that are battery-powered, and further challenged by the growing demands to pack increasing functionalities into IoT devices while shrinking their sizes. To address these problems, researchers have developed techniques for energy harvesting, wireless power transfer, and minimizing power consumption in the sensing, communication and computation components of IoT nodes, as found in many surveys. In contrast, this paper surveys Backscatter Communication (BackCom), a recently emerged technique that enables green IoT through joint wireless communication and sensing and potentially allows IoT devices to operate without batteries. The operating principle of BackCom-based green IoT, its architecture and evolution are presented. Also state-of-the-art applications such as healthcare, agriculture, human activity recognition, transportation and mobile IoT are reviewed together with the operational and security challenges faced by these applications and potential solution techniques to address these challenges while ensuring a high energy efficiency. Lastly, some future applications of BackCom-based green IoT are discussed.},

abstract = {Millimeter wave communication is eminently suitable for high-rate wireless systems, which may be beneficially amalgamated with intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), while relying on beam-index modulation. Explicitly, we propose three different architectures based on IRSs for beam-index modulation in millimeter wave communication. Our schemes are capable of eliminating the detrimental line-of-sight blockage of millimeter wave frequencies.The schemes are termed as single-symbol beam index modulation, multi-symbol beam-index modulation and maximum-SNR single-symbol beam index modulation. The principle behind these is to embed the information both in classic QAM/PSK symbols and in the transmitter beam-pattern. Explicitly, we proposed to use a twin-IRS structure to construct a low-cost beam-index modulation scheme. We conceive both the optimal maximum likelihood detector and a low-complexity compressed sensing detector for the proposed schemes. Finally, the schemes designed are evaluated through extensive simulations and the results are compared to our analytical bounds.},

The interaction mechanism between the reader and the tag is described in a physically meaningful way by the reciprocity theorem which is deeply rooted into Maxwell equations. This approach provides a simple and yet complete formulation that allows to fully describe the interaction between the reader and the tag, even in complex environments. From this formulation, a clear understanding is derived on how the different design tradeoffs affect system performance.

In this paper, we consider a precoding matrix design for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SWIPT systems with finite-alphabet inputs. The problem can be formulated as maximizing the mutual information given the energy level and the power constraint for achieving a so-called rate-energy region. The formulated problem is non-concave, which can be reduced to a convex power allocation problem by the proposed gradient-descend design of the precoding matrix. Several rate-energy regions can be achieved by trading off between the information rate and the harvested energy with different schemes. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme with finite-alphabet inputs provides significant performance gain over existing schemes with Gaussian inputs.},

Delivering both wireless information provision (WIP) and wireless energy provision (WEP) services in the RF band requires a holistic design of wireless information and energy provision (WIEP) for achieving energy self-sustainability in the next generation of wireless networks, such as 6G. However, most of the existing works studied the integrated WIEP performance by exploiting Gaussian distributed signals with the infinite alphabet, which cannot be realised in a practical communication system. Therefore, we investigate the WIEP performance by considering practical modulation schemes having finite alphabet in a well-known Nakagami-m wireless fading channel. Furthermore, we jointly optimise the transmit power allocation and the transmission switching threshold of a WIEP transmitter and the power splitting ratio of a WIEP receiver in order to maximise the attainable spectrum efficiency for WIP, while satisfying both the WEP requirement and the WIP reliability constraint. Numerical results are provided for characterising the rate-energy-reliability trade-off of different modulation schemes in various wireless fading conditions.},

abstract = {The future of mobile communications looks exciting with the potential new use cases and challenging requirements of future 6th generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks. Since the beginning of the modern era of wireless communications, the propagation medium has been perceived as a randomly behaving entity between the transmitter and the receiver, which degrades the quality of the received signal due to the uncontrollable interactions of the transmitted radio waves with the surrounding objects. The recent advent of reconflgurable intelligent surfaces in wireless communications enables, on the other hand, network operators to control the scattering, reflection, and refraction characteristics of the radiowaves, by overcoming the negative effects of natural wireless propagation. Recent results have revealed that reconflgurable intelligent surfaces can effectively control the wavefront, e.g., the phase, amplitude, frequency, and even polarization, of the impinging signals without the need of complex decoding, encoding, and radio frequency processing operations. Motivated by the potential of this emerging technology, the present article is aimed to provide the readers with a detailed overview and historical perspective on state-of-the-art solutions, and to elaborate on the fundamental differences with other technologies, the most important open research issues to tackle, and the reasons why the use of reconflgurable intelligent surfaces necessitates to rethink the communication-theoretic models currently employed in wireless networks. This article also explores theoretical performance limits of reconflgurable intelligent surface-assisted communication systems using mathematical techniques and elaborates on the potential use cases of intelligent surfaces in 6G and beyond wireless networks.},

Leveraging a small-signal model for a nonlinear energy harvester, a general form of the delivered power in terms of system baseband parameters is derived, which demonstrates the dependency of the delivered power on higher moments of the baseband channel input. The optimization problem of maximizing rate-power (RP) region is studied. Assuming that the channel state information (CSI) is available at both the receiver and the transmitter, and constraining to the non-zero mean Gaussian input distributions, an optimization algorithm for power allocation among different subchannels is studied. As a special case, optimality conditions for zero mean Gaussian inputs are derived. Results obtained from the numerical optimization demonstrate the superiority of the non-zero mean Gaussian inputs (with asymmetric power allocation in each complex subchannel) in yielding a larger RP region compared to their zero mean and non-zero mean (with symmetric power allocation in each complex subchannel) counterparts. The results motivate the design of new modulation for SWIPT and contrast with the SWIPT design under linear energy harvesting, for which the circularly symmetric Gaussian inputs with water-filling power allocation are optimal.},

PAB nodes harvest energy from underwater acoustic signals using piezoelectric interfaces and communicate by modulating the piezoelectric impedance. Our design introduces innovations that enable concurrent multiple access through circuit-based frequency tuning of backscatter modulation and a MAC that exploits the properties of PAB nodes to deliver higher network throughput and decode network collisions.

In uplink NOMA, more than one user can use the same subcarrier, which increases the system throughput and fairness. Due to the non-orthogonality among the users, joint processing is required at the receiver to retrieve the users' signals. In this paper, we propose solutions to optimize the receiver and the radio resource allocation of uplink NOMA. First, we propose an iterative multiuser detection and decoding (MUDD) to improve the performance of the multiuser detector by utilizing the information derived by the channel decoder. In addition, a novel subcarrier and power allocation algorithm is proposed for NOMA scheme that maximizes the users' weighted sumrate. The link-level performance evaluation has shown that the proposed iterative MUDD approach brings about 4.5 dB and 9.8 dB performance improvements at block error rate equal to 10 -2 comparing to conventional multiuser detection, for QPSK and 16QAM modulations, respectively. Furthermore, the systemlevel results show that the proposed resource allocation algorithm achieves the system spectral efficiency upper-bound, making NOMA significantly outperforms OFDMA in terms of spectral efficiency and fairness.},

On the other hand, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recently proposed as a promising approach that can control the propagation environment especially in indoor communication environments. In this paper, we propose a new AmBC model over ambient orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers in the frequency domain in conjunction with RIS for short-range communication scenarios. A tag transmits one bit per each OFDM subcarrier broadcasted from a WiFi access point. Then, RIS augments the signal quality at a reader by compensating the phase distortion effect of multipath channel on the incident signal. We also exploit the special spectrum structure of OFDM to transmit more data over its squeezed orthogonal subcarriers in the frequency domain. Consequently, the proposed method improves the bit-error-rate (BER) performance and provides a higher data rate compared to existing AmBC methods. Analytical and numerical evaluations show the superior performance of the proposed approach in terms of BER and data rate.},

abstract = {This letter studies a symbiotic radio network (SRN) with multiple backscatter devices (BDs) coexisting with a primary receiver. A hybrid peer-assisted non-orthogonal-multiple-access (NOMA)-plus-dynamic-time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) scheme is proposed. Under this scheme, BDs are categorized into different clusters, and only one cluster is allowed to transmit in each time slot. Within each cluster, NOMA is adopted. The latter cluster can harvest energy from previous clusters using peer assistance. We maximize the minimum throughput among all BDs by jointly optimizing the BS&#x2019;s power allocation, BDs&#x2019; power reflection coefficients and the time allocation under practical constraints. Particularly, a practical energy causality constraint is considered, and the effect of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) of NOMA is also studied. Numerical results show that the peer-assisted NOMA-plus-TDMA scheme achieves satisfactory throughput gain over conventional schemes. It is also shown that peer assistance does help in terms of improving the system throughput and fairness.},

abstract = {Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising new solution to provide convenient and perpetual energy supplies to wireless networks. In practice, WPT is implementable by various technologies such as inductive coupling, magnetic resonate coupling, and electromagnetic (EM) radiation, for short-/mid-/long- range applications, respectively. In this paper, we consider the EM or radio signal enabled WPT in particular. Since radio signals can carry energy as well as information at the same time, a unified study on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is pursued. Specifically, this paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless broadcast system consisting of three nodes, where one receiver harvests energy and another receiver decodes information separately from the signals sent by a common transmitter, and all the transmitter and receivers may be equipped with multiple antennas. Two scenarios are examined, in which the information receiver and energy receiver are separated and see different MIMO channels from the transmitter, or co-located and see the identical MIMO channel from the transmitter. For the case of separated receivers, we derive the optimal transmission strategy to achieve different tradeoffs for maximal information rate versus energy transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. For the case of co-located receivers, we show an outer bound for the achievable R-E region due to the potential limitation that practical energy harvesting receivers are not yet able to decode information directly. Under this constraint, we investigate two practical designs for the co-located receiver case, namely time switching and power splitting, and characterize their achievable R-E regions in comparison to the outer bound. {\textcopyright} 2002-2012 IEEE.},

The beamforming vectors are designed by solving a total transmission power minimization (TPM) problem with quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. In order to solve the proposed nonconvex optimization problem, we provide an efficient method using semidefinite relaxation. Moreover, for the first time, we characterize the optimal beamforming in a closed form with quasi-degradation condition, which is proven to achieve the same performance as dirty-paper coding (DPC). For the special case with two users, we further show that the original nonconvex TPM problem can be equivalently transferred into a convex optimization problem and easily solved via standard optimization tools. In addition, the optimal beamforming is also characterized in a closed form and we show that it achieves the same performance as the DPC. In the simulation, we show that our proposed optimal NOMA beamforming outperforms OMA schemes and can even achieve the same performance as DPC. Our solutions dramatically simplifies the problem of beamforming design in the downlink MISO NOMA systems and improve the system performance.},

abstract = {Over-the-air computation (AirComp) is a disruptive technique for fast wireless data aggregation in Internet of Things (IoT) networks via exploiting the waveform superposition property of multiple-access channels. However, the performance of AirComp is bottlenecked by the worst channel condition among all links between the IoT devices and the access point. In this paper, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted AirComp system is proposed to boost the received signal power and thus mitigate the performance bottleneck by reconfiguring the propagation channels. With an objective to minimize the AirComp distortion, we propose a joint design of AirComp transceivers and RIS phase-shifts, which however turns out to be a highly intractable non-convex programming problem. To this end, we develop a novel alternating minimization framework in conjunction with the successive convex approximation technique, which is proved to converge monotonically. To reduce the computational complexity, we transform the subproblem in each alternation as a smooth convex-concave saddle point problem, which is then tackled by proposing a Mirror-Prox method that only involves a sequence of closed-form updates. Simulations show that the computation time of the proposed algorithm can be two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the state-of-the-art algorithms, while achieving a similar distortion performance.},

@article{Mao2020a,
abstract = {Cooperative Rate-Splitting (CRS) strategy, relying on linearly precoded rate-splitting at the transmitter and opportunistic transmission of the common message by the relaying user, has recently been shown to outperform typical Non-cooperative Rate-Splitting (NRS), Cooperative Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (C-NOMA) and Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) in a two-user Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC) with user relaying. In this work, the existing two-user CRS transmission strategy is generalized to the K-user case. We study the problem of jointly optimizing the precoders, message split, time slot allocation, and relaying user scheduling with the objective of maximizing the minimum rate among users subject to a transmit power constraint at the base station. As the user scheduling problem is discrete and the entire problem is non-convex, we propose a two-stage low-complexity algorithm to solve the problem. Both centralized and decentralized relaying protocols based on selecting K{1} ( K{1} < K ) strongest users are first proposed followed by a Successive Convex Approximation (SCA)-based algorithm to jointly optimize the time slot, precoders and message split. Numerical results show that by applying the proposed two-stage algorithm, the worst-case achievable rate achieved by CRS is significantly increased over that of NRS and SDMA in a wide range of network loads (underloaded and overloaded regimes) and user deployments (with a diversity of channel strengths). Importantly, the proposed SCA-based algorithm dramatically reduces the computational complexity without any rate loss compared with the conventional algorithm in the literature of CRS. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed K-user CRS combined with the two-stage algorithm is more powerful than the existing transmission schemes.},

In contrast with the literature that relies on an inaccurate linear model of the energy harvester, an experimentally-validated nonlinear model is considered. A general form of the delivered Direct Current (DC) power in terms of system baseband parameters is derived, which demonstrates the dependency of the delivered DC power on higher order statistics of the channel input distribution. The optimization problem of maximizing Rate-Power (R-P) region is studied. Assuming that the Channel gain is known at both the receiver and the transmitter, and constraining to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channel inputs determined only by their first and second moment statistics, an inner bound for the general problem is obtained. Notably, as a consequence of the harvester nonlinearity, the studied inner bound exhibits a tradeoff between the delivered power and the rate of received information. It is shown that the tradeoff-characterizing input distribution is with mean zero and with asymmetric power allocations to the real and imaginary dimensions.},

A new co-operative SWIPT NOMA protocol is proposed, in which near NOMA users that are close to the source act as energy harvesting relays to help far NOMA users. Since the locations of users have a significant impact on the performance, three user selection schemes based on the user distances from the base station are proposed. To characterize the performance of the proposed selection schemes, closed-form expressions for the outage probability and system throughput are derived. These analytical results demonstrate that the use of SWIPT will not jeopardize the diversity gain compared to the conventional NOMA. The proposed results confirm that the opportunistic use of node locations for user selection can achieve low outage probability and deliver superior throughput in comparison to the random selection scheme.},

Extending the finite battery life of massive number of IoT devices is a crucial challenge. The ultra-low-power backscatter communications (BackCom) with the inherent feature of RF energy harvesting is a promising technology for tackling this challenge. Moreover, many future IoT applications will require the deployment of dense IoT devices, which induces strong interference for wireless information transfer (IT). To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose the design of a novel multiple-access scheme based on time-hopping spread-spectrum (TH-SS) to simultaneously suppress interference and enable both two-way wireless IT and one-way wireless energy transfer (ET) in coexisting backscatter reader-tag links. The performance analysis of the BackCom network is presented, including the bit-error rates for forward and backward IT and the expected energy-transfer rate for forward ET, which account for non-coherent and coherent detection at tags and readers, and energy harvesting at tags, respectively. Our analysis demonstrates a tradeoff between energy harvesting and interference performance. Thus, system parameters need to be chosen carefully to satisfy given BackCom system performance requirement.},

Promising signal strategies to maximize the power transfer efficiency of WPT rely on (energy) beamforming, waveform, modulation and transmit diversity, and a combination thereof. To a great extent, the study of those strategies has so far been limited to theoretical performance analysis. In this paper, we study the real over-the-air performance of all the aforementioned signal strategies for WPT. To that end, we have designed, prototyped and experimented an innovative radiative WPT architecture based on Software-Defined Radio (SDR) that can operate in open-loop and closed-loop (with channel acquisition at the transmitter) modes. The prototype consists of three important blocks, namely the channel estimator, the signal generator, and the energy harvester. The experiments have been conducted in a variety of deployments, including frequency flat and frequency selective channels, under static and mobility conditions. Experiments highlight that a channeladaptive WPT architecture based on joint beamforming and waveform design offers significant performance improvements in harvested DC power over conventional single-antenna/multiantenna continuous wave systems. The experimental results fully validate the observations predicted from the theoretical signal designs and confirm the crucial and beneficial role played by the energy harvester nonlinearity.},

In this article, we introduce the emerging paradigm called wireless communication enabled by programmable metasurfaces to address the above issues, by exploiting the powerful capability of metasurfaces in manipulating electromagnetic waves. We will first introduce the basic concept of programmable metasurfaces, followed by the promising paradigm shift in future wireless communication systems enabled by programmable metasurfaces. In particular, we give an overview of the two prospective paradigms of applying programmable metasurfaces in wireless transceivers, namely, RF chain-free transmitter and space-down-conversion receiver, which both have great potential to simplify the architecture and reduce the hardware cost of future wireless transceivers. Furthermore, we present the design architectures, preliminary experimental results and main advantages of these new paradigms and discuss their potential opportunities and challenges toward ultra-massive 6G communications with low hardware complexity, low cost, and high energy efficiency.},

abstract = {In this article, a symbiotic radio (SR) system is proposed to support passive Internet of Things (IoT), in which a backscatter device (BD), also called IoT device, is parasitic in a primary transmission. The primary transmitter (PT) is designed to assist both the primary and BD transmissions, and the primary receiver (PR) is used to decode the information from the PT as well as the BD. The symbol period for BD transmission is assumed to be either equal to or much greater than that of the primary one, resulting in parasitic SR (PSR) or commensal SR (CSR) setup. We consider a basic SR system which consists of three nodes: 1) a multiantenna PT; 2) a single-antenna BD; and 3) a single-antenna PR. We first derive the achievable rates for the primary and BD transmissions for each setup. Then, we formulate two transmit beamforming optimization problems, i.e., the weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) problem and the transmit power minimization (TPM) problem, and solve these nonconvex problems by applying the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. In addition, a novel transmit beamforming structure is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the solutions. The simulation results show that for CSR setup, the proposed solution enables the opportunistic transmission for the BD via energy-efficient passive backscattering without any loss in spectral efficiency, by properly exploiting the additional signal path from the BD.},

abstract = {Considering ubiquitous connectivity and advanced information processing capability, huge amount of low-power IoT devices are deployed nowadays and the maintenance of those devices which includes firmware/software updates and recharging the units has become a bottleneck for IoT systems. For addressing limited battery constraints, wireless power transfer is a promising approach such that it does not require any physical link between energy harvester and power transfer. Furthermore, combining wireless power transfer with information transmission has become more appealing. In the systems that apply radio signals the wireless power transfer has become a popular trend to harvest RF-radiated energy from received information signal in IoT devices. For those systems, design frameworks mainly deal with the trade-off between information capacity and energy harvesting efficiency. Therein various signaling design frameworks have been proposed for different system preferences between power and information. In addition to this, protecting the information part from potential eavesdropping activity in a service area introduces security considerations for those systems. In this paper, we propose a novel concept, Information Harvesting, for wireless power transfer systems. It introduces a novel protocol design from opposite perspective compared to the existing studies. Particularly, Information Harvesting aims to transmit information through existing wireless power transfer mechanism without interfering/interrupting power transfer.},

abstract = {Information-theoretic limits to spectral efficiency in dense wavelength-division-multiplexed (DWDM) transmission systems are reviewed, considering various modulation techniques (unconstrained, constant-intensity, binary), detection techniques (coherent, direct), and propagation regimes (linear, nonlinear). Spontaneous emission from inline optical amplifiers is assumed to be the dominant noise source in all cases. Coherent detection allows use of two degrees of freedom per polarization, and its spectral efficiency limits are several b/s/Hz in typical terrestrial systems, even considering nonlinear effects. Using either constant-intensity modulation or direct detection, only one degree of freedom per polarization can be used, significantly reducing spectral efficiency. Using binary modulation, regardless of detection technique, spectral efficiency cannot exceed 1 b/s/Hz per polarization. When the number of signal and/or noise photons is small, the particle nature of photons must be considered. The quantum-limited spectral efficiency for coherent detection is slightly smaller than the classical capacity, but that for direct detection is 0.3 b/s/Hz higher than its classical counterpart. Various binary and nonbinary modulation techniques, in conjunction with appropriate detection techniques, are compared in terms of their spectral efficiencies and signal-to-noise ratio requirements, assuming amplified spontaneous emission is the dominant noise source. These include a) pulse-amplitude modulation with direct detection, b) differential phase-shift keying with interferometric detection, c) phase-shift keying with coherent detection, and d) quadrature-amplitude modulation with coherent detection.},

abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) over orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) signals has recently been proposed as an appealing technique for low power Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. The special spectrum structure of OFDM signals provides a range of flexibility in terms of bit-error-rate (BER) performance, data rate, and power consumption. In this paper, we study subcarrier-wise backscatter communication over ambient OFDM signals. This new AmBC is to exploit the special spectrum structure of OFDM to transmit data over its squeezed orthogonal subcarriers. We propose a basis transmission scheme, and its two modifications to support a higher data rate with superior BER performance compared to existing methods. The basis scheme can transmit one bit per subcarrier using on-off keying (OOK) modulation in the frequency domain. In the first modification, interleaved subcarrier block transmission model is employed to improve the BER performance of the system in frequency-selective channels. It results in a trade-off between the size of the blocks, and data rate. Thus, in the second modification, interleaved index modulation (IM) is employed to mitigate the data rate decrementation of the former modification. It also stabilizes, and controls the power of the signal to result in interference reduction for a legacy receiver. Analytical, and numerical evaluations provide a proof to see the performance of the proposed method in terms of BER, data rate, and interference.},

The superiority of the proposed designs is investigated by simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed reflecting and precoding designs can offer a lower SER than existing designs with the assumption of complex Gaussian input.

This game-changing technology is especially important for stepping into the Internet of Everything (IoE) era, where high performance is demanded with very limited available resources. In this paper, we study a backscatter-assisted wireless powered communication network (BS-WPCN), in which a number of energy-constrained users, powered by a power station (PS), transmit information to an access point (AP) via backscatter and active wireless information transfer, with their communication being aided by an IRS. Using a practical energy harvesting (EH) model which is able to capture the characteristics of realistic energy harvesters, we investigate the maximization of total network throughput. Specifically, IRS reflection coefficients, PS transmit and AP receive beamforming vectors, power and time allocation are designed through a two-stage algorithm, assuming minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver at the AP. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is confirmed via extensive numerical simulations. We also show that our proposed scheme is readily applicable to practical IRS-aided networks with discrete phase shift values.},

abstract = {The capacity of a complex and discrete-time memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel under three constraints, namely, input average power, input amplitude and output delivered power is studied. The output delivered power constraint is modelled as the average of linear combination of even moments of the channel input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the capacity of an AWGN channel under transmit average power and receiver delivered power constraints is the same as the capacity of an AWGN channel under an average power constraint. However, depending on the two constraints, the capacity can be either achieved by a Gaussian distribution or arbitrarily approached by using time-sharing between a Gaussian distribution and On-Off Keying. As an application, a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) problem is studied, where an experimentally-validated nonlinear model of the harvester is used. It is shown that the delivered power depends on higher order moments of the channel input. Two inner bounds, one based on complex Gaussian inputs and the other based on further restricting the delivered power are obtained for the Rate-Power (RP) region. For Gaussian inputs, the optimal inputs are zero mean and a tradeoff between transmitted information and delivered power is recognized by considering asymmetric power allocations between inphase and quadrature subchannels. Through numerical algorithms, it is observed that input distributions (obtained by restricting the delivered power) attain larger RP region compared to Gaussian input counterparts.},

We first show that the optimization problem for the MBCN without successive interference cancellation (SIC) has a similarity with the problem considered for a wireless power communication network but the conventional algorithm is not applicable to the MBCN with SIC.

Due to its simple hardware and support for wireless power transfer, it is well suited for the implementation of IoT networks. In this paper, we consider a backscatter relay network where backscatter devices are wirelessly powered by a hybrid access point (HAP). The signals beamformed by the HAP also act as carrier emitters for backscatter devices to modulate and transmit data. Some backscatter devices are unable to directly communicate with the HAP. Nearby backscatter devices present in the network assist these devices with a goal of providing access to the HAP and improving their throughput via cooperative transmission. A maximization problem is formulated to maximize the overall throughput of a distant device with a relay strategy for the considered backscatter relay network. We also propose a procedure to acquire accurate channel information of all the channels to ensure efficient beamforming at the HAP. Numerical results show that accurate channel information can significantly improve the overall throughput of the proposed backscatter relay network. Performance evaluation of the proposed scheme shows the effect of different system parameters on the overall system throughput.},

abstract = {Wireless power transfer (WPT) has long been one of the main goals of Nikola Tesla, the forefather of electromagnetic applications. In this paper, we investigate radio-frequency beamforming in the radiative far field for WPT. First, an analytical model of the channel fading is presented, and a blind adaptive beamforming algorithm is adapted to the WPT context. The algorithm is computationally light, because we need not explicitly estimate the channel state information. Then, a testbed with a multiple-antenna software-defined radio configuration on the transmitting side and a programmable energy harvester on the receiving side is developed in order to validate the algorithm in this specific power application. From the results, it can be seen that the implementation of this version of beamforming indeed improves the harvested power. Specifically, at various distances from 50 cm to 1.5 m, the algorithm converges with two, three, and four antennas with an increasing gain as we increase the number of antennas. These encouraging results could have far-reaching consequences in providing wireless power to Internet of Things devices, our target application.},

In this letter, we propose a practical transmission protocol to execute channel estimation and reflection optimization successively for an IRS-enhanced orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Under the unit-modulus constraint, a novel reflection pattern at the IRS is designed to aid the channel estimation at the access point (AP) based on the received pilot signals from the user, for which the channel estimation error is derived in closed-form.

abstract = {Radio frequency (RF)-powered backscatter communication between passive tags holds tremendous potential as an enabling technology for a ubiquitous 'Internet of Things.' We develop a backscattering tag-to-tag network (BTTN), comprised of passive tags capable of large-scale, passive, and multihop communication with each other via backscatter modulation of an external RF excitation signal. The low sensitivity and lack of active demodulator on passive tags present significant challenges to the communication, including a unique phase cancellation problem, which significantly affects the range and robustness of a passive tag-to-tag link. We overcome these challenges using innovative tag architecture and also develop a novel multiphase backscatter modulation technique with a learning mechanism that overcomes the phase cancellation problem. This improves the link performance bringing passive tag-to-tag communication closer to practical use. The additional hardware compared to the conventional radio frequency identification tag architecture includes one more terminating impedance in the modulator. The data rate is reduced due to backscatter at two different phases while the increase in the power consumption is negligible. We develop prototype BTTN tag hardware and firmware and evaluate its performance. The prototype achieves link ranges of up to 3 m at 5 kb/s with an excitation power level of only-20 dBm while successfully overcoming phase cancellation. We further extend BTTN operation to a multihop network where we demonstrate a four hop link capable of communicating over 12 m under similar conditions.},

The choice of the load can be tricky, showing an advantage of a certain type of signals over another. For low RF power (-17dBm), the multitone signals do not improve the peak RF-to-dc power conversion efficiency (PCE) over the continuous wave (CW) single-tone signal, if the optimal load is selected for each case, however, the multitone signals maintain that peak PCE of ∼ 47% over higher output voltage (i.e: larger loads), and consequently enable more efficient dc-to-dc voltage boosting or even eliminate the need for the voltage booster in the RF power receiver. Thus, the low-power multitone waveforms can be considered as a voltage sensitivity booster rather than a PCE efficiency booster. This boosted rectified voltage is the key advantage of the multitone signals that leads to the enhancement in the overall efficiency of the low-RF power receiver.},

abstract = {This paper studies intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided full-duplex (FD) wireless-powered communication network (WPCN), where a hybrid access point (HAP) broadcasts energy signals to multiple devices for their energy harvesting in the downlink (DL) and meanwhile receives information signals in the uplink (UL) with the help of IRS. Particularly, we propose three types of IRS beamforming configurations to strike a balance between the system performance and signaling overhead as well as implementation complexity. We first propose the fully dynamic IRS beamforming, where the IRS phase-shift vectors vary with each time slot for both DL wireless energy transfer (WET) and UL wireless information transmission (WIT). To further reduce signaling overhead and implementation complexity, we then study two special cases, namely, partially dynamic IRS beamforming and static IRS beamforming. For the former case, two different phase-shift vectors can be exploited for the DL WET and the UL WIT, respectively, whereas for the latter case, the same phase-shift vector needs to be applied for both DL and UL transmissions. We aim to maximize the system throughput by jointly optimizing the time allocation, HAP transmit power, and IRS phase shifts for the above three cases. Two efficient algorithms based on alternating optimization and penalty-based algorithms are respectively proposed for both perfect self-interference cancellation (SIC) case and imperfect SIC case by applying successive convex approximation and difference-of-convex optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of IRS for enhancing the performance of FD-WPCN, and also show that the IRS-aided FD-WPCN is able to achieve significantly performance gain compared to its counterpart with half-duplex when the self-interference (SI) is properly suppressed.},

First, we consider the weighted sum bit error rate (BER) minimization problem among all IRSs by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, IRS phase shift matrix, and IRS scheduling, subject to the minimum primary rate requirements. To tackle this complicated problem, a relaxation-based algorithm is proposed. We prove that the converged relaxation scheduling variables are binary, which means that no reconstruct strategy is needed, and thus the UAV rate constraints are automatically satisfied. Second, we consider the fairness BER optimization problem. We find that the relaxation-based method cannot solve this fairness BER problem since the minimum primary rate requirements may not be satisfied by the binary reconstruction operation. To address this issue, we first transform the binary constraints into a series of equivalent equality constraints. Then, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to obtain a suboptimal solution.

abstract = {The increasing use of backscatter radio for pervasive Internet-of-Things systems as a low-power and low-cost communication scheme will result in dense deployments of tags that need to operate under bandwidth (BW) constraints. Typical backscatter tags and computational radio frequency (RF) identification systems are unnecessarily limited to modulating data with 'ON-OFF' switching front-ends, which leads to extensive spectrum occupancy, due to the rectangular pulses. This paper sets the foundations to overcome these limitations and proposes designs of RF front-ends that are capable of varying the tag reflection coefficient in a continuous way over time. Arbitrary waveforms can be generated to perform pulse shaping on the backscattered signals, which require significantly reduced BW. The principles presented in this paper will enable sophisticated tags to perform complex modulation schemes under BW constraints, while maintaining a very low RF front-end complexity, using a single nonlinear component such as a p-i-n diode or field-effect transistor. Migrating the idea of pulse shaping from complex power-demanding active radios to such minimal RF front-ends will complete backscatter radio as a communication scheme for simple RF tags and sensors in large-scale deployments. Each tag becomes a miniature software-defined radio that implements diverse communication schemes with increased spectral efficiency.},

In this scenario, analytical investigation of channel capacity is extremely challenging for finite-size systems since the channel matrices have a very general form where each path may have a different power. Hence, in this paper, we consider the ergodic sum capacity of a macrodiversity multiple-input multiple-output system with arbitrary numbers of sources and receive antennas operating over Rayleigh fading channels. For this system, we compute the exact ergodic capacity for a system with at most two transmit antennas and a compact approximation for the general system, which is shown to be very accurate over a wide range of cases. Finally, we compare our results with previous asymptotic results and bounds. Results are verified by Monte Carlo simulations and the impact on capacity of various channel power profiles is investigated. {\textcopyright} 1963-2012 IEEE.},

The problem of finding the optimal transmit filter is non-convex and intractable to solve using low complexity methods. Motivated by recent results highlighting the relationship between mutual information and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), this paper establishes a relationship between weighted sum-rate and weighted MMSE in the MIMO-BC. The relationship is used to propose a low complexity algorithm for finding a local weighted sum-rate optimum based on alternating optimization.

abstract = {Multiple antenna technologies have attracted much research interest for several decades and have gradually made their way into mainstream communication systems. Two main benefits are adaptive beamforming gains and spatial multiplexing, leading to high data rates per user and per cell, especially when large antenna arrays are adopted. Since multiple antenna technology has become a key component of the fifth-generation (5G) networks, it is time for the research community to look for new multiple antenna technologies to meet the immensely higher data rate, reliability, and traffic demands in the beyond 5G era. Radically new approaches are required to achieve orders-of-magnitude improvements in these metrics. There will be large technical challenges, many of which are yet to be identified. In this paper, we survey three new multiple antenna technologies that can play key roles in beyond 5G networks: cell-free massive MIMO, beamspace massive MIMO, and intelligent reflecting surfaces. For each of these technologies, we present the fundamental motivation, key characteristics, recent technical progresses, and provide our perspectives for future research directions. The paper is not meant to be a survey/tutorial of a mature subject, but rather serve as a catalyst to encourage more research and experiments in these multiple antenna technologies.},

abstract = {Super-resolution is generally referred to as the task of recovering fine details from coarse information. Motivated by applications, such as single-molecule imaging, radar imaging, etc., we consider parameter estimation of complex exponentials from their modulations with unknown waveforms, allowing for non-stationary blind super-resolution. This problem, however, is ill-posed since both the parameters associated with the complex exponentials and the modulating waveforms are unknown. To alleviate this, we assume that the unknown waveforms live in a common low-dimensional subspace. Using a lifting trick, we recast the blind super-resolution problem as a structured low-rank matrix recovery problem. Atomic norm minimization is then used to enforce the structured low-rankness, and is reformulated as a semidefinite program that is solvable in polynomial time. We show that, up to scaling ambiguities, exact recovery of both of the complex exponential parameters and the unknown waveforms is possible when the waveform subspace is random and the number of measurements is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in the problem. Numerical simulations support our theoretical findings, showing that non-stationary blind super-resolution using atomic norm minimization is possible.},

abstract = {Future Internet-of-Things (IoT) is expected to wirelessly connect billions of low-complexity devices. For wireless information transfer (IT) in IoT, high density of IoT devices and their ad hoc communication result in strong interference, which acts as a bottleneck on wireless IT. Furthermore, battery replacement for the massive number of IoT devices is difficult if not infeasible, making wireless energy transfer (ET) desirable. This motivates: 1) the design of full-duplex wireless IT to reduce latency and enable efficient spectrum utilization and 2) the implementation of passive IoT devices using backscatter antennas that enable wireless ET from one device (reader) to another (tag). However, the resultant increase in the density of simultaneous links exacerbates the interference issue. This issue is addressed in this paper by proposing the design of full-duplex backscatter communication (BackCom) networks, where a novel multiple-access scheme based on time-hopping spread-spectrum is designed to enable both one-way wireless ET and two-way wireless IT in coexisting backscatter reader-tag links. Comprehensive performance analysis of BackCom networks is presented in this paper, including forward/backward bit-error rates and wireless ET efficiency and outage probabilities, which accounts for energy harvesting at tags, non-coherent and coherent detection at tags and readers, respectively, and the effects of asynchronous transmissions.},

This paper shows that pinhole diversity is available in a rich scattering environment caused by modulating backscatter with multiple RF tag antennas-no diversity combining at the reader, channel knowledge, or signaling scheme change is required. Pinhole diversity, along with increased RF tag scattering aperture, can cause up to a 10 dB reduction in the power required to maintain a constant bit-error-rate for an RF tag with two antennas. Through examples, it is shown that this gain results in increased backscatter radio system communication reliability and up to a 78% increase in RF tag operating range. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is expected to be a technology reshaping the landscape of low-power applications such as the Internet of Things. Multi-antenna multi-sine waveforms adaptive to the channel state information have been shown to be a promising building block of WPT. However, the current design is computationally too complex to be applied to large-scale WPT, where signals are sent across a large number (tens) of antennas and frequencies. This paper proposes efficient single/multi-user algorithms based on a generalizable optimization framework, in order to design transmit waveforms that maximize the weighted-sum/minimum rectenna output DC voltage. The study highlights the significant effect of the nonlinearity of the rectenna on the design of waveforms in single/multi-user systems. Interestingly, in the single-user case, the optimal spatial beamforming, obtained before optimizing power allocation across frequencies, turns out to be maximum ratio transmission. Nevertheless, in the general multi-user weighted-sum criterion maximization problem, optimizations in the frequency and the spatial domains are coupled. Assuming channel hardening, we also propose low-complexity algorithms based on asymptotic analysis, where the structure of the asymptotically optimal spatial beamforming can be found before optimizations. Simulation results confirm the inefficiency of the linear model-based design in single/multi-user systems. Moreover, simulation results show that the proposed algorithms (based on the nonlinear model) can benefit from an increasing number of sinewaves at a computational cost much lower than the existing method. Simulation results also indicate that the large-scale WPT architecture can boost the end-to-end power transfer efficiency and the transmission range.},

abstract = {Traditional passive UHF RFID tags employ either ASK or PSK backscatter modulation to communicate data from memory or sensors on the tag to a remotely-located reader. These simple modulation schemes transfer data at a rate of one bit per symbol period, which for an integrated CMOS tag IC requires an on-chip oscillator with a frequency at least equal to the bit rate. Motivated by the fact that most modern UHF RFID readers already employ I/Q demodulation of the backscattered signal to account for backscatter phase rotation as the tag moves with respect to the reader, we propose a QAM backscatter method using no on-chip inductors that is compatible with a single-chip CMOS tag implementation.With QAM backscatter, tags transmit more than one data bit per symbol period, permitting tag designers to employ a lower power on-chip oscillator operating at a frequency equal to the (lower) symbol rate while maintaining the same data throughput as ASK or PSK, or alternatively to send data at a higher rate for a given on-chip oscillator frequency. We present the fundamental design equations required for arbitrary QAM backscatter modulators and present simulated bit error rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM) curves for the operation of an inductor-free 4-QAM and 8-QAM modulator centered at 915MHz and evaluated over the 860MHz-950MHz worldwide UHF band. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

The most challenging feature is to enhance their sensitivity, the weakest activation signal the receiver is able to sense, which is limited by the minimum turn-on voltage of the diode-based detector. In order to operate the detector at even lower power levels, a strategy to optimize the modulated WuR excitations is presented, exploiting high-peak intermittent continuous waves while preserving the required average power per bit. The design and implementation of an ultralow-power detector, fed by a dual-band antenna and loaded by the WuR backend is presented: 2.45-GHz and 868-MHz operations of the same WuR are demonstrated, with added flexibility and interoperability among different communication bands. We show that a correct WuR activation is possible with an average power per bit as low as -63 dBm at 2.45 GHz and -65 dBm at 868 MHz.

abstract = {While two-way communication can improve the spectral efficiency of wireless networks, distances from the relay to the two users are usually asymmetric, leading to excessive wireless energy at the nearby user. To exploit the excessive energy, energy harvesting at user terminals is a viable option. Unfortunately, the exact gain brought by wireless power transfer (WPT) in two-way communication is currently unknown. To fill this gap, in this paper, the achievable rate region of wirelessly powered two-way communication with a fixed relay is derived. Not only this newly established result is shown to enclose the existing achievable rate region of two-way relay channel without energy harvesting but also the gain is precisely quantified. On the other hand, it is well-known that a major obstacle to WPT is the path-loss. By endowing the relay with mobility, the distances between the relay and users can be varied, thus providing a potential solution to combat pathloss at the expense of energy for transmission. To characterize the consequence brought by such a scheme, a pair of inner and outer bounds to the achievable rate region of wirelessly powered two-way communication under a mobile relay is further derived. By comparing the exact achievable rate region for the fixed relay case and the achievable rate bounds for the mobile relay case, it is possible to quantify the relative advantage of spending energy on moving versus on transmission in wirelessly powered two-way communication.},

The constituent components were implemented and tested as stand-alone devices and were subsequently combined in a measurement system using interconnectors. The effect of the tunable PS was explored with respect to the SNR measurements on the port that is intended for the information decoding receiver and the DC voltage measurements on the termination load of the rectifier that is connected directly on the energy harvesting port of the tunable PS. A spectrum analyzer is used for the SNR measurements while the input power is controlled using a signal generator. Both wireless power transmission and on-board measurements verify that the harvested energy can be maximized by using the minimum SNR at the information decoding branch at the expense of DC power consumption required for the biasing of the varactor diodes.},

It is worth noting that multiple-antenna tags could perform energy harvesting and backscattering simultaneously and thus are advantageous for ambient backscatter communication systems. Therefore, in this paper, we consider the ambient backscatter communication systems with multiple-antenna tags and focus on signal detection problem. Multiple antennas imply multiple channel parameters, which are difficult to estimate because the tags have limited power and can transmit few training symbols. To address this problem, a semi-blind detector is designed for readers to recover tag signals without any knowledge of the multiple channel parameters between the reader and the tag. We also derive the bounds on the detection probabilities. Moreover, an antenna selection scheme is suggested to optimize the detection performance. Finally, simulation results are provided to corroborate our theoretical studies.},

abstract = {Energy harvesting is a promising solution to prolong the operation time of energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the flat-fading channel, where the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy via WEH from the signals sent by the transmitter. We first consider a SISO (single-input single-output) system where the single-antenna receiver cannot decode information and harvest energy independently from the same signal received. Under this practical constraint, we propose a dynamic power splitting (DPS) scheme, where the received signal is split into two streams with adjustable power levels for information decoding and energy harvesting separately based on the instantaneous channel condition that is assumed to be known at the receiver. We derive the optimal power splitting rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between the maximum ergodic capacity for information transfer and the maximum average harvested energy for power transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called «rate-energy (R-E)» region. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information is also known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmitter power control and receiver power splitting. The achievable R-E region by the proposed DPS scheme is also compared against that by the existing time switching scheme as well as a performance upper bound by ignoring the practical receiver constraint. Finally, we extend the result for optimal DPS to the SIMO (single-input multiple-output) system where the receiver is equipped with multiple antennas. In particular, we investigate a low-complexity power splitting scheme, namely antenna switching, which achieves the near-optimal rate-energy trade-offs as compared to the optimal DPS. {\textcopyright} 1972-2012 IEEE.},

However, the receiver design becomes much more complicated due to the presence of inter-user and inter-BD interference. To address these issues, we propose a novel receiver design to perform joint channel estimation, user data decoding, and BD symbol detection. Specifically, motivated by the idea of approximate message passing, we develop a computationally efficient iterative algorithm under the Bayesian inference framework to resolve the joint estimation problem.

For each scheme, the optimal reflection coefficient or the optimal primary transmit power are derived and closed-form expressions of outage probability are then developed for both primary and backscatter systems. Also, asymptotic outage behavior is characterized in the high transmit signal-To-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Our analysis shows that for the backscatter system, both parasitic and competitive schemes achieve the same outage probability which is irrelevant to the backscatter channels, whereas the commensal scheme can attain exactly the same asymptotic outage performance with the other two schemes at high transmit SNR. In addition, as the SNR threshold of the backscatter system approaches to zero, the three schemes can achieve the same outage performance for the backscatter system. Finally, the theoretical results are validated via Monte-Carlo simulations.},

However, existing studies on energy beamforming fail to simultaneously take energy supply and information transfer in WPBC into account. This paper takes the first step to fill this gap, by considering the restrictive relationship between the energy harvesting rate and achievable rate with estimated backscatter channel state information (BS-CSI). To ensure reliable communication and user fairness, we formulate the energy beamforming design as a max-min optimization problem by maximizing the minimum achievable rate for all backscatter tags subject to the energy constraint. We derive the closed-form expression of the energy harvesting rate, as well as the lower bound of the achievable rate for maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers. Our numerical results indicate that our scheme significantly outperforms state-of-the-art energy beamforming schemes. Additionally, the achievable rate of our scheme approaches more than 90% of the rate limit achieved via beamforming with perfect CSI for both receivers.},

In Part I, we obtained the ergodic capacity region of the fading broadcast channel under different spectrum-sharing techniques. In this paper, we derive the outage capacity regions of fading broadcast channels, assuming that both the transmitter and the receivers have perfect channel side information. These capacity regions and the associate optimal resource allocation policies are obtained for code division (CD) with and without successive decoding, for time division (TD), and for frequency division (FD). We show that in an M-user broadcast system, the outage capacity region is implicitly obtained by deriving the outage probability region for a given rate vector. Given the required rate of each user, we find a strategy which bounds the outage probability region for different spectrum-sharing techniques. The corresponding optimal power allocation scheme is a multiuser generalization of the threshold-decision rule for a single-user fading channel. Also discussed is a simpler minimum common outage probability problem under the assumption that the broadcast channel is either not used at all when fading is severe or used simultaneously for all users. Numerical results for the different outage capacity regions are obtained for the Nakagami-m fading model.},

This paper demonstrates that, in a linear tag array with a tag separation of 1 cm, the interaction between the backscattered waves and incident wave causes a significant degradation in tag sensitivity. It is found that the use of tags that have polarization diversity can improve the read performance when they are placed in close proximity to one another compared with conventional linear tags. Two ways of achieving polarization diversity are studied in this paper, namely: 1) using a circularly polarized tag and 2) using a cross-polarized tag pair. Both methods show an improvement in close proximity read performance and it is experimentally demonstrated that by using cross-polarized tag pairs in an array, one achieves on average a 2.6-dB increase in read power margin for a 57-tag array with 1 cm separation compared with using conventional linearly polarized tags.},

The objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive tutorial overview of the subject, in conjunction with circuit calculations and numerical simulations that illustrate the fundamental concepts of how antennas behave as both receivers and scatterers of electromagnetic fields and power. The paper begins with a discussion of the basic concepts associated with antenna impedance, as these are fundamental to understanding the antenna's receiving and scattering properties, particularly over a wide range of frequencies, where the circuit properties of the antenna differ. The definitions of aperture efficiency, absorption efficiency, and the validity of using either a Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit to determine both received and total scattered power are discussed. Circuit circulations and numerical simulations, determining both total received and scattered powers, are presented for a number of antennas, including a straight-wide dipole, a circular loop, a reflector-backed dipole, and a Yagi antenna. We show that Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits have limited validity when used to determine the total power scattered by a basic antenna element such as the dipole and loop. For the general antenna, these equivalent circuit models are not valid for determining the total scattered power. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

In particular, we jointly optimize the transmit power of the source and the reflection coefficient of the backscatter tag to enhance the sum-rate of the system. Closed-form solutions are derived for the considered joint optimization problem via iteratively computing the Lagrange multipliers by the sub-gradient method. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed joint optimization framework over other benchmark frameworks, namely suboptimal PD-NOMA AmBC, optimal pure PD-NOMA, and orthogonal multiple access.},

In this paper, an expression for symbol error probability for some common communication schemes over double-Rayleigh fading wireless channels is derived. It is shown that double scattering results in severe degradation in symbol error probability.

abstract = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems, presently standardized under EPC Global Class-1 Gen-2, have attracted increasing interest as the next-generation technology for tagged object identification. One of the important objectives of this work is to highlight the fact that the performance of the backscatter uplink (determined by constellation choice and forward error correction) is coupled to the downlink via the power harvesting functionality. The concept of normalized power loss per bit is introduced for such RFID communication systems to capture the consequent trade-offs, that form the crux of the results. We explore the use of higher dimensional (4-QAM) modulation schemes in future RFID systems (beyond current binary modulation in Class-1 Gen 2) as a means to improve uplink bit rate. However, this results in significantly increased normalized power loss vis-a-vis 2-PSK, suggesting a role for FEC coding. New coded modulation schemes - based on unequal error protection - are proposed that provides additional degrees of freedom (via choice of code parameters) to trade-off spectral efficiency with normalized power loss. This is explored and quantified, resulting in design recommendations. {\textcopyright} 1972-2012 IEEE.},

@article{Singya2020,
abstract = {As the research on beyond 5G heats up, we survey and explore power and bandwidth efficient modulation schemes in details. In the existing publications and in various communication standards, initially square quadrature amplitude modulation (SQAM) constellations (even power of 2) were considered. However, only the square constellations are not efficient for varying channel conditions and rate requirements, and hence, odd power of 2 constellations were introduced. For odd power of 2 constellations, rectangular QAM (RQAM) is commonly used. However, RQAM is not a good choice due to its lower power efficiency, and a modified cross QAM (XQAM) constellation is preferred as it provides improved power efficiency over RQAM due to its energy efficient two dimensional (2D) structure. The increasing demand for high data-rates has further encouraged the research towards more compact 2D constellations which lead to hexagonal lattice structure based constellations, referred to as hexagonal QAM (HQAM). In this work, various QAM constellations are discussed and detailed study of star QAM, XQAM, and HQAM constellations is presented. Generation, peak and average energies, peak-to-average-power ratio, symbol-error-rate, decision boundaries, bit mapping, Gray code penalty, and bit-error-rate of star QAM, XQAM, and HQAM constellations with different constellation orders are presented. Finally, a comparative study of various QAM constellations is presented which justifies the supremacy of HQAM over other QAM constellations. With this, it can be claimed that the use of the HQAM in various wireless communication systems and standards can further improve the performance targeted for beyond 5G wireless communication systems.},

We characterize the optimal transmit strategy by the optimal distribution of the transmit symbol vector that maximizes the average harvested power at the EH subject to a constraint on the power budget of the transmitter. We show that the optimal transmit strategy employs scalar unit-norm input symbols with arbitrary phase and two beamforming vectors, which are determined as solutions of a non-convex optimization problem. To solve this problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on a two-dimensional grid search, semidefinite relaxation, and successive convex approximation. Our simulation results reveal that the proposed MIMO WPT design significantly outperforms two baseline schemes based on a linear EH model and a single beamforming vector, respectively. Finally, we show that the average harvested power grows linearly with the number of rectennas at the EH node and saturates for a large number of TX antennas.},

Therefore, it has been considered as a promising candidate for the future Internet-of-Things with stringent energy and spectrum constraints. In this paper, we investigate a full-duplex-enabled cognitive backscatter network, in which an AmBC system underlays a primary cellular system, and the primary access point can transmit primary signals and receive backscatter signals simultaneously via full-duplex communications. We aim to maximize the throughput of the AmBC system while guaranteeing the minimum rate requirements of the primary system via joint time scheduling, transmit power allocation, and reflection coefficient (RC) adjustment. To solve the problem, we propose an iterative method utilizing block coordinated decent to partition the variables into the time scheduling variable and the joint transmit power allocation and RC adjustment variable. For the time scheduling problem, we first prove its convexity and then utilize the interior-point method to solve it. For the joint power allocation and RC adjustment problem, we resort to the concave-convex procedure to transform it into a sequence of convex optimization problems, and then adopt Lagrange dual decomposition to tackle these convex optimization problems. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly increase the throughput of the AmBC system with a fast convergence speed.},

This provides extra degree of freedom to improve the overall network performance. As such, we propose a throughput maximization problem by jointly optimizing the PBS' energy beamforming and the radios' transmission scheduling strategies in two modes. We show that the throughput maximization is easily tractable by solving a semi-definite program. However, it becomes non-convex and intractable when we allow radios' cooperation in data transmissions. To this end, we propose a set of heuristic algorithms with different complexities for cooperative relay transmissions, which are shown to significantly improve the sum throughput compared to the non-cooperative case.

We use this duality result to evaluate the system capacity achievable in a cellular wireless network with multiple antennas at the base station and multiple antennas at each terminal. Some fundamental properties of the rate region are exhibited and algorithms for determining the optimal weighted rate sum and the optimal covariance matrices for achieving a given rate vector on the boundary of the rate region are presented. These algorithms are then used in a simulation study to determine potential capacity enhancements to a cellular system through known-interference cancellation. We study both the circuit data scenario in which each user requires a constant data rate in every frame and the packet data scenario in which users can be assigned a variable rate in each frame so as to maximize the long-term average throughput. In the case of circuit data, the outage probability as a function of the number of active users served at a given rate is determined through simulations. For the packet data case, long-term average throughputs that can be achieved using the proportionally fair scheduling algorithm are determined. We generalized the zero-forcing beamforming technique to the multiple receive antennas case and use this as the baseline for the packet data throughput evaluation.},

abstract = {Scatter radio achieves communication by reflection and requires low-cost and low-power RF front-ends. However, its use in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is limited, since commercial scatter radio (e.g. RFID) offers short ranges of a few tens of meters. This work redesigns scatter radio systems and maximizes range through non-classic bistatic architectures: the carrier emitter is detached from the reader. It is shown that conventional radio receivers may show a potential 3dB performance loss, since they do not exploit the correct signal model for scatter radio links. Receivers for on-off-keying (OOK) and frequency-shift keying (FSK) that overcome the frequency offset between the carrier emitter and the reader are presented. Additionally, non-coherent designs are also offered. This work emphasizes that sensor tag design should accompany receiver design. Impact of important parameters such as the antenna structural mode are presented through bit error rate (BER) results. Experimental measurements corroborate the long-range ability of bistatic radio; ranges of up to 130 meters with 20 milliwatts of carrier power are experimentally demonstrated, with commodity software radio and no directional antennas. Therefore, bistatic scatter radio may be viewed as a key enabling technology for large-scale, low-cost and low-power WSNs. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Based on this result, a new multiple-access technique called rate-splitting multiple accessing (RSMA) is proposed. RSMA is a code-division multiple-access scheme for the M-user Gaussian multiple-access channel for which the effort of finding the codes for the M users, of encoding, and of decoding is that of at most 2M-I independent point-to-point Gaussian channels.

In particular, the multicast subscribers are served as secondary users underlaying a primary user. To enhance the secondary user fairness and compensate for the primary user, a two-stage cooperative strategy is proposed by selecting a certain secondary user to perform NOMA transmission distributedly. The maximum ratio combining (MRC) is further employed to harvest spatial diversity. We explicitly formulate the primary outage probability and secondary ergodic throughput in closed form. Moreover, we derive the asymptotic expressions and accordingly investigate the power allocation optimization with a primary outage constraint to maximize the secondary throughput.

abstract = {Bistatic backscatter communication (BackCom) allows passive tags to transmit over extended ranges, but at the cost of having carrier emitters either transmitting at high powers or being deployed very close to tags. In this paper, we examine how the presence of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) could benefit the bistatic BackCom system. We study the transmit power minimization problem at the carrier emitter, where its transmit beamforming vector is jointly optimized with the IRS phase shifts, whilst guaranteeing a required BackCom performance. A unique feature in this system setup is the multiple IRS reflections experienced by signals traveling from the carrier emitter to the reader, which renders the optimization problem highly nonconvex. Therefore, we propose algorithms based on the minorization-maximization and alternating optimization techniques to obtain approximate solutions for the joint design. We also propose low-complexity algorithms based on successive optimization of individual phase shifts. Our results reveal considerable transmit power savings in both single-tag and multi-tag systems, even with moderate IRS sizes, which may be translated to significant range improvements using the original transmit power or reduce the reliance of tags on carrier emitters located at close range.},

abstract = {Wireless power transfer and backscatter communications have emerged as promising solutions for energizing and communicating with power limited devices. Despite some progress in wirelessly powered backscatter communications, the focus has been on backscatter and energy harvesters (EHs). Recently, significant progress has been made on the design of the transmit multisine waveform, adaptive to the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), in a point-to-point backscatter system. In this paper, we leverage the work and study the design of the transmit multisine waveform in a multiuser backscatter system, made of one transmitter, one reader, and multiple tags active simultaneously. We derive an efficient algorithm to optimize the transmit waveform so as to identify the tradeoff between the amount of energy harvested at the tags and the reliability of the communication, measured in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the reader. The performance with the optimized waveform based on the linear and nonlinear EH models is studied. The numerical results demonstrate the benefits of accounting for the EH nonlinearity, multiuser diversity, frequency diversity, and multisine waveform adaptive to the CSIT to enlarge the SINR-energy region.},

This paper proposes a novel MFSK modulation for the Tag of ambient backscatter communications systems, and the corresponding detectors are designed depending on the capability of the Reader. In the case the Reader is not capable of removing the direct interference from the ambient source, a maximum likelihood detector is proposed. In another case, leveraging on the frequency shift feature of the MFSK modulation, the Reader can remove the direct interference. Then, a simple energy detector is proposed, and the closed-form expressions for the symbol error rate (SER) and outage probability of the system are derived. The findings of this paper suggest that the proposed MFSK modulation outperforms the popular ON-OFF keying modulation, and the impact of modulation order on the SER performance depends heavily on the operating bit signal to noise ratio. Moreover, it is shown that it is desirable to place the Tag close to the Reader in terms of minimizing the outage probability.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an emerging technique to enhance the wireless communication spectral efficiency with low hardware and energy cost. In this letter, we consider the integration of IRS to an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based multiuser downlink communication system, and study the pertinent joint optimization of the IRS reflection coefficients and OFDMA time-frequency resource block as well as power allocations to maximize the users' common (minimum) rate. Specifically, due to the lack of frequency-selective passive beamforming capability at the IRS, only one set of reflection coefficients can be designed for adapting to a large number of channels of multiple users over different frequency sub-bands. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a novel dynamic passive beamforming scheme where the IRS reflection coefficients are dynamically adjusted over different time slots within each channel coherence block to create artificial time-varying channels and select only a subset of the users to be simultaneously served in each time slot, thus achieving a higher passive beamforming gain. Although the formulated optimization problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to it. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the system common rate over the setup without IRS and that with random IRS reflection coefficients. Moreover, our proposed dynamic passive beamforming outperforms the fixed passive beamforming which employs a common set of reflection coefficients in each channel coherence block, by more flexibly balancing between passive beamforming and multiuser diversity gains.},

Among various enabling technologies for UAVs, wireless communication is essential and has drawn significantly growing attention in recent years. Compared to the conventional terrestrial communications, UAVs' communications face new challenges due to their high altitude above the ground and great flexibility of movement in the 3-D space. Several critical issues arise, including the line-of-sight (LoS) dominant UAV-ground channels and induced strong aerial-terrestrial network interference, the distinct communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for UAV control messages versus payload data, the stringent constraints imposed by the size, weight, and power (SWAP) limitations of UAVs, as well as the exploitation of the new design degree of freedom (DoF) brought by the highly controllable 3-D UAV mobility. In this article, we give a tutorial overview of the recent advances in UAV communications to address the above issues, with an emphasis on how to integrate UAVs into the forthcoming fifth-generation (5G) and future cellular networks. In particular, we partition our discussion into two promising research and application frameworks of UAV communications, namely UAV-assisted wireless communications and cellular-connected UAVs, where UAVs are integrated into the network as new aerial communication platforms and users, respectively. Furthermore, we point out promising directions for future research.},

One major problem is dealing with the interference between the backscatter devices, which is usually not taken into account, or simply treated as noise in the cases where there are a limited number of backscatter devices in the network. In order to better understand this problem in the context of massive IoT (Internet of Things), we consider a network with a base station having one antenna, serving one primary user, and multiple IoT devices, called secondary users. We formulate an optimization problem with the goal of minimizing the needed transmit power for the base station, while the ratio of backscattered signal, called backscatter coefficient, is optimized for each of the IoT devices. Such an optimization problem is non-convex and thus finding an optimal solution in real-time is challenging. In this paper, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal solution, and show that it is unique. Furthermore, we develop an efficient solution algorithm, only requiring solving a linear system of equations with as many unknowns as the number of secondary users. The simulation results show a lower energy outage probability by up to 40-80 percentage points in dense networks with up to 150 secondary users. To our knowledge, this is the first work that studies backscatter communication in the context of massive IoT, also taking into account the interference between devices.},

However, these technologies face two main practical limitations 1) the lack of control over the wireless channel, and 2) the high power consumption of the wireless interface. To address the need for green and sustainable future cellular networks, the concept of reconfiguring wireless propagation environments using Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS)s has emerged. An IRS comprises of a large number of low-cost passive antennas that can smartly reflect the impinging electromagnetic waves for performance enhancement. This paper looks at the evolution of the reflective radio concept towards IRSs, outlines the IRS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication model and discusses how it differentiates from the conventional multi-antenna communication models. We propose a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) based channel estimation protocol for the design and analysis of IRS-assisted systems. Performance evaluation results at 2.5 GHz operating frequency are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed system.},

abstract = {The vision of embedding connectivity into billions of everyday objects runs into the reality of existing communicationtechnologies — there is no existing wireless technology that can provide reliable and long-range communication at tens ofmicrowatts of power as well as cost less than a dime. While backscatter is low-power and low-cost, it is known to be limitedto short ranges. This paper overturns this conventional wisdom about backscatter and presents the first wide-area backscattersystem. Our design can successfully backscatter from any location between an RF source and receiver, separated by 475 m,while being compatible with commodity LoRa hardware. Further, when our backscatter device is co-located with the RFsource, the receiver can be as far as 2.8 km away. We deploy our system in a 4,800ft2(446m2) house spread across threefloors, a 13,024ft2(1210m2) office area covering 41 rooms, as well as a one-acre (4046m2) vegetable farm and show that wecan achieve reliable coverage, using only a single RF source and receiver. We also build a contact lens prototype as well as aflexible epidermal patch device attached to the human skin. We show that these devices can reliably backscatter data across a3,328ft2(309m2) room. Finally, we present a design sketch of a LoRa backscatter IC that shows that it costs less than a dimeat scale and consumes only 9.25$\mu$W of power, which is more than 1000x lower power than LoRa radio chipsets.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has recently been envisioned to offer unprecedented massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-like gains by deploying large-scale and low-cost passive reflection elements. By adjusting the reflection coefficients, the IRS can change the phase shifts on the impinging electromagnetic waves so that it can smartly reconfigure the signal propagation environment and enhance the power of the desired received signal or suppress the interference signal. In this paper, we consider downlink multigroup multicast communication systems assisted by an IRS. We aim for maximizing the sum rate of all the multicasting groups by the joint optimization of the precoding matrix at the base station (BS) and the reflection coefficients at the IRS under both the power and unit-modulus constraint. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose two efficient algorithms under the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm framework. Specifically, a concave lower bound surrogate objective function of each user's rate has been derived firstly, based on which two sets of variables can be updated alternately by solving two corresponding second-order cone programming (SOCP) problems. Then, in order to reduce the computational complexity, we derive another concave lower bound function of each group's rate for each set of variables at every iteration, and obtain the closed-form solutions under these loose surrogate objective functions. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the benefits in terms of the spectral and energy efficiency of the introduced IRS and the effectiveness in terms of the convergence and complexity of our proposed algorithms.},

It is found that the narrow-ring approximation is valid for a ring width less than 0.025A with A being the wavelength of the FSS's resonant frequency. A single screen double-ring element FSS is demonstrated for (1) a low-pass FSS that reflects the Ka-band signal while passing the S-, X-, and Ku-band signals, and (2) a Tri-bandsystem that reflects the X-band signal while transmitting through the S- and Ku-band signals. In addition, a double screen four-band FSS with non-similar double-ring elements is developed by cascading the above mentioned two single screens.

We also pay special attention to non- Euclidean settings (relevant algorithms include Frank-Wolfe, mirror descent, and dual averaging) and discuss their relevance in machine learning. We provide a gentle introduction to structural optimization with FISTA (to optimize a sum of a smooth and a simple non-smooth term), saddle-point mirror prox (Nemirovski's alternative to Nesterov's smoothing), and a concise description of interior point methods. In stochastic optimization we discuss stochastic gradient descent, minibatches, random coordinate descent, and sublinear algorithms. We also briefly touch upon convex relaxation of combinatorial problems and the use of randomness to round solutions, as well as random walks based methods.},

abstract = {We propose a variable-rate and variable-power MQAM modulation scheme for high-speed data transmission over fading channels. We first review results for the Shannon capacity of fading channels with channel side information, where capacity is achieved using adaptive transmission techniques. We then derive the spectral efficiency of our proposed modulation. We show that there is a constant power gap between the spectral efficiency of our proposed technique and the channel capacity, and this gap is a simple function of the required bit5or rate (BER). In addition, using just five or six different signal constellations, we achieve within 1-2 dB of the maximum efficiency using unrestricted constellation sets. We compute the rate at which the transmitter needs to update its power and rate as a function of the channel Doppler frequency for these constellation sets. We also obtain the exact efficiency loss for smaller constellation sets, which may be required if the transmitter adaptation rate is constrained by hardware limitations. Our modulation scheme exhibits a 5-10-dB power gain relative to variable-power fixed-rate transmission, and up to 20 dB of gain relative to nonadaptive transmission. We also determine the effect of channel estimation error and delay on the BER performance of our adaptive scheme. We conclude with a discussion of coding techniques and the relationship between our proposed modulation and Shannon capacity. {\textcopyright} 1997 IEEE.},

@article{Wang2014,
abstract = {In this paper, we study a probabilistically robust transmit optimization problem under imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and under the multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink scenario. The main issue is to keep the probability of each user's achievable rate outage as caused by CSI uncertainties below a given threshold. As is well known, such rate outage constraints present a significant analytical and computational challenge. Indeed, they do not admit simple closed-form expressions and are unlikely to be efficiently computable in general. Assuming Gaussian CSI uncertainties, we first review a traditional robust optimization-based method for approximating the rate outage constraints, and then develop two novel approximation methods using probabilistic techniques. Interestingly, these three methods can be viewed as implementing different tractable analytic upper bounds on the tail probability of a complex Gaussian quadratic form, and they provide convex restrictions, or safe tractable approximations, of the original rate outage constraints. In particular, a feasible solution from any one of these methods will automatically satisfy the rate outage constraints, and all three methods involve convex conic programs that can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf solvers. We then proceed to study the performance-complexity tradeoffs of these methods through computational complexity and comparative approximation performance analyses. Finally, simulation results are provided to benchmark the three convex restriction methods against the state of the art in the literature. The results show that all three methods offer significantly improved solution quality and much lower complexity.},

abstract = {Ambient backscatter communications have been identified for ultra-low energy wireless communications. Indeed, a tag can send a message to a reader without emitting any wave and without battery, simply by backscattering the waves generated by a source. In the simplest implementation of such a system, the tag sends a binary message by oscillating between two states and the reader detects the bits by comparing the two distinct received powers. In this paper, for the first time, we propose to study an ambient backscatter communication system, in the presence of a diffusing surface, a simple flat panel that diffuses in all directions. We establish the analytical closed form expression of the power contrast in the presence of the surface. We show that the diffusing surface improves the power contrast. Moreover our approach allows us to express the contrast to noise ratio, and therefore to establish the BER performance. Furthermore, we derive the optimum source transmit power for a given target power contrast. This makes it possible to quantify the amount of energy that can be saved at the source side, thanks to the diffusing surface.},

A special case of the problem that we study corresponds to the max-3-cut model used in a recent paper of Goemans and Williamson [J. Comput. System Sci., 68 (2004), pp. 442-470]. We first develop a closed-form formula to compute the probability of a complex-valued normally distributed bivariate random vector to be in a given angular region. This formula allows us to compute the expected value of a randomized (with a specific rounding rule) solution based on the optimal solution of the complex semidefinite programming relaxation problem. In particular, we present an {m2(1 -cos 2$\pi$/m)/87$\pi$]-approximation algorithm, and then study the limit of that model, in which the problem remains NP-hard. We show that if the objective is to maximize a positive semidefinite Hermitian form, then the randomization-rounding procedure guarantees a worst-case performance ratio of $\pi$/4 ≈ 0.7854, which is better than the ratio of 2/$\pi$ ≈ 0.6366 for its counterpart in the real case due to Nesterov. Furthermore, if the objective matrix is real-valued positive semidefinite with nonpositive off-diagonal elements, then the performance ratio improves to 0.9349. {\textcopyright} 2006 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.}},

abstract = {A geometric program (GP) is a type of mathematical optimization problem characterized by objective and constraint functions that have a special form. Recently developed solution methods can solve even large-scale GPs extremely efficiently and reliably; at the same time a number of practical problems, particularly in circuit design, have been found to be equivalent to (or well approximated by) GPs. Putting these two together, we get effective solutions for the practical problems. The basic approach in GP modeling is to attempt to express a practical problem, such as an engineering analysis or design problem, in GP format. In the best case, this formulation is exact; when this is not possible, we settle for an approximate formulation. This tutorial paper collects together in one place the basic background material needed to do GP modeling. We start with the basic definitions and facts, and some methods used to transform problems into GP format. We show how to recognize functions and problems compatible with GP, and how to approximate functions or data in a form compatible with GP (when this is possible). We give some simple and representative examples, and also describe some common extensions of GP, along with methods for solving (or approximately solving) them. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

Conventional AmBC receivers are interested in recovering the information from the ambient backscatter device (A-BD) only. In this paper, we propose a cooperative AmBC (CABC) system in which the reader recovers information not only from the A-BD, but also from the RF source. We first establish the system model for the CABC system from spread spectrum and spectrum sharing perspectives. Then, for flat fading channels, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, suboptimal linear detectors as well as successive interference-cancellation (SIC) based detectors. For frequency-selective fading channels, the system model for the CABC system over ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing carriers is proposed, upon which a low-complexity optimal ML detector is derived. For both kinds of channels, the bit-error-rate expressions for the proposed detectors are derived in closed forms. Finally, extensive numerical results have shown that, when the A-BD signal and the RF-source signal have equal symbol period, the proposed SIC-based detectors can achieve near-ML detection performance for typical application scenarios, and when the A-BD symbol period is longer than the RF-source symbol period, the existence of backscattered signal in the CABC system can enhance the ML detection performance of the RF-source signal, thanks to the beneficial effect of the backscatter link when the A-BD transmits at a lower rate than the RF source.},

The PBs transmit a sinusoidal continuous wave (CW) and the BNs reflect back a portion of this signal while harvesting the remaining part. A BN harvests energy from multiple nearby PBs and modulates its information bits on the composite CW through backscatter modulation. The analysis poses real challenges due to the double fading channel, and its dependence on the PPPs of both the BNs and PBs. However, with the help of stochastic geometry, we derive the coverage probability and the capacity of the network in tractable and easily computable expressions, which depend on different system parameters. We observe that the coverage probability decreases with an increase in the density of the BNs, while the capacity of the network improves. We further compare the performance of this network with a regular powered network in which the BNs have a reliable power source and show that for a very high density of the PBs, the coverage probability of the former network approaches that of the regular powered network.},

abstract = {The newly emerging wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs) have recently drawn significant attention, where radio signals are used to power wireless terminals for information transmission. In this paper, we study a WPCN where one multi-antenna access point (AP) coordinates energy transfer and information transfer to/from a set of single-antenna users. A harvest-then-transmit protocol is assumed where the AP first broadcasts wireless power to all users via energy beamforming in the downlink (DL), and then, the users send their independent information to the AP simultaneously in the uplink (UL) using their harvested energy. To optimize the users' throughput and yet guarantee their rate fairness, we maximize the minimum throughput among all users by a joint design of the DL-UL time allocation, the DL energy beamforming, and the UL transmit power allocation, as well as receive beamforming. We solve this nonconvex problem optimally by two steps. First, we fix the DL-UL time allocation and obtain the optimal DL energy beamforming, UL power allocation, and receive beamforming to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of all users. This problem is shown to be still nonconvex; however, we convert it equivalently to a spectral radius minimization problem, which can be solved efficiently by applying the alternating optimization based on the nonnegative matrix theory. Then, the optimal time allocation is found by a one-dimensional search to maximize the minimum rate of all users. Furthermore, two suboptimal designs of lower complexity are also proposed, and their throughput performance is compared against that of the optimal solution.},

abstract = {In this work, we consider a monostatic backscatter communication system employing successive interference cancellation where a reader simultaneously serves multiple backscatter tags or nodes (BNs). To minimise collisions, each BN randomly chooses a sub-frame to backscatter the continuous wave signal transmitted by the reader only if its received power is above a backscatter threshold. The reader then employs successive interference cancellation technique to resolve the resulting smaller number of collisions. Using stochastic geometry, we derive an approximate yet accurate expression for the average number of successfully decoded BNs. Our derived expression allows the system performance to be predicted numerically and also allows us to determine the backscatter threshold to maximize the system performance.},

abstract = {Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is no longer a “wild” or “promising” concept for future cellular networks—in 2018 it became a reality. Base stations (BSs) with 64 fully digital transceiver chains were commercially deployed in several countries, the key ingredients of Massive MIMO have made it into the 5G standard, the signal processing methods required to achieve unprecedented spectral efficiency have been developed, and the limitation due to pilot contamination has been resolved. Even the development of fully digital Massive MIMO arrays for mmWave frequencies—once viewed prohibitively complicated and costly—is well underway. In a few years, Massive MIMO with fully digital transceivers will be a mainstream feature at both sub-6 GHz and mmWave frequencies. In this paper, we explain how the first chapter of the Massive MIMO research saga has come to an end, while the story has just begun. The coming wide-scale deployment of BSs with massive antenna arrays opens the door to a brand new world where spatial processing capabilities are omnipresent. In addition to mobile broadband services, the antennas can be used for other communication applications, such as low-power machine-type or ultra-reliable communications, as well as non-communication applications such as radar, sensing and positioning. We outline five new Massive MIMO related research directions: Extremely large aperture arrays, Holographic Massive MIMO, Six-dimensional positioning, Large-scale MIMO radar, and Intelligent Massive MIMO.},

Employing a power splitting receiver, we derive closed-form analytical results including cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the harvested energy, CDF of the achievable rate, average harvested energy, and average achievable rate. We also investigate the effect of adjustable $\alpha$ factor in the proposed scheduling scheme and multiuser diversity in terms of the CDF of the harvested energy, the CDF of the achievable rate, and rate-energy tradeoff, compared with two conventional scheduling schemes: random scheduling and max-SNR scheduling.

By adaptively varying the incident signals' phases/amplitudes and thereby establishing favorable channel responses through a large number of reconfigurable passive reflecting elements, IRS is able to enhance the communication performance of mobile users in its vicinity cost- effectively. In this paper, we study an IRS- enhanced orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system in which an IRS is deployed to assist the communication between a nearby user and its associated base station (BS). We aim to maximize the downlink achievable rate for the user by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation at the BS and the passive array reflection coefficients at the IRS. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and thus difficult to solve, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution for it, by alternately optimizing the BS's power allocation and the IRS's passive array coefficients in an iterative manner, along with a customized method for the initialization. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly improves the OFDM link rate performance as compared to the cases without the IRS or with other heuristic IRS designs.},

Different from existing noncoherent schemes, we here design the semi-coherent detection, where channel-related parameters can be obtained from unknown data symbols and a few pilot symbols. In order to obtain a benchmark for overall detection, we first derive a maximum likelihood detector assuming a complex Gaussian ambient source, and the closed-form bit error rate (BER) is computed. To release the dependence on prior knowledge of the ambient source, we next derive a type of robust design, called an energy detector, with the ambient signal being either complex Gaussian or phase shift keying (PSK). The closed-form detection thresholds, analytical BERs, and outage probability are provided correspondingly. Interestingly, the complex Gaussian source would cause an error floor, while the PSK source does not, which brings nontrivial indication of constellation design as opposed to popular Gaussian-embedded literatures. We also propose an effective approach to estimate detection-required parameters rather than channels themselves. Numerical simulations are finally presented to verify theoretical results.},

However, most recent investigation utilized an ideal IRS reflection model, which is impractical and can cause significant performance degradation in realistic wideband systems. In this work, we first study the amplitude-frequency-phase relationship of reflected signals and present a simplified practical IRS reflection model for wideband signals. Then, an IRS enhanced wideband multiuser multi-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MU-MISO-OFDM) system is investigated. We aim to jointly design the transmit beamformer and IRS reflection to maximize the average sum-rate over all subcarriers. With the aid of the relationship between sum-rate maximization and mean square error (MSE) minimization, the original problem is equivalently transformed into a multi-block/variable problem, which can be solved by classic block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Complexity and convergence for both cases are analyzed or illustrated. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can offer significant average sum-rate enhancement compared to that achieved using the ideal reflection model, which confirms the importance of the use of the practical model for the design of wideband systems.},

We show that in the high Signal-toInterference Ratios (SIR) regime, these nonlinear and apparently difficult, nonconvex optimization problems can be transformed into convex optimization problems in the form of geometric programming; hence they can be very efficiently solved for global optimality even with a large number of users. In the medium to low SIR regime, some of these constrained nonlinear optimization of power control cannot be turned into tractable convex formulations, but a heuristic can be used to compute in most cases the optimal solution by solving a series of geometric programs through the approach of successive convex approximation. While efficient and robust algorithms have been extensively studied for centralized solutions of geometric programs, distributed algorithms have not been explored before. We present a systematic method of distributed algorithms for power control that is geometric- programming-based. These techniques for power control, together with their implications to admission control and pricing in wireless networks, are illustrated through several numerical examples. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {High-efficiency rectennas for radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting have been studied for decades, but most of the literature straightforwardly applies the rectenna aiming at dedicated RF sources to this situation, even though the level of input power is significantly different. Since previous studies address antenna design collecting more ambient RF power, the improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) has emerged in a scattered way, because the theoretical limit of PCE has not yet been characterized, and the optimal rectenna structure approaching such maximum PCE is still uninvestigated. In this paper, we characterize the performance limit of rectennas with input power ranging from -20 to 0 dBm, proposing optimal rectenna design demonstrating the maximum PCE. The maximum achievable PCE is cast into a mathematical programming problem. Solving this optimization model clarifies the effect of design factors, including operational frequencies, rectifier topologies, and parameterization. To achieve the maximum PCE, our investigation shows that the optimal rectenna structure should not only optimize those design factors but also eliminate the matching circuit between an antenna and a rectifier for ultralow-power scenarios. The resultant PCE at 2.45 GHz is 61.4% and 31.8% at -5 and -15 dBm, respectively, closely approaching the theoretical bound.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider a novel ambient backscatter multiple-access system, where a receiver (Rx) simultaneously detects the signals transmitted from an active transmitter (Tx) and a backscatter tag. Specifically, the information-carrying signal sent by the Tx arrives at the Rx through two wireless channels: the direct channel from the Tx to the Rx and the backscatter channel from the Tx to the tag and then to the Rx. The received signal from the backscatter channel also carries the tag's information because of the multiplicative backscatter operation at the tag. This multiple-access system introduces a new channel model referred to as backscatter multiplicative multiple-access channel (BM-MAC). We analyze the achievable rate region of the BM-MAC and prove that its region is strictly larger than that of the conventional time-division multiple-access scheme in many cases, including, e.g., the high SNR regime and the case when the direct channel is much stronger than the backscatter channel. Hence, the multiplicative multiple-access scheme is an attractive technique to improve the throughput for ambient backscatter communication systems. Moreover, we analyze the detection error rates for coherent and noncoherent modulation schemes adopted by the Tx and the tag, respectively, in both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios, which further bring interesting insights for practical system design.},

Ambient backscattering devices reflect RF signals emitted by existing or legacy communications systems, such as digital TV broadcasting, cellular, or Wi-Fi ones, which are designed for transporting information and are not intended for RF energy transfer. This paper deals with mathematical modeling and performance analysis of wireless broadband networks operating over fading channels with ambient backscatter devices. After introducing a detailed signal model of the relevant communication links, we study the influence of physical parameters on the capacity of both legacy and backscatter channels, by considering different receiver architectures. We analytically show that, under reasonable operative conditions, a legacy system - employing an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme - can turn the RF interference arising from the backscatter process into a form of multipath diversity that can be exploited to increase its performance. Moreover, our analysis proves that a backscatter system - transmitting one symbol per OFDM symbol of the legacy system - can achieve satisfactory data rates over relatively short distances, especially when the intended recipient of the backscatter signal is co-located with the legacy transmitter, i.e., they are on the same device.},

abstract = {Quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) with double-sided constraints has plenty of applications in signal processing as have been addressed in recent years. QCQP problems are hard to solve, in general, and they are typically approached by solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation followed by a postprocessing procedure. Existing postprocessing schemes include Gaussian randomization to generate an approximate solution, rank reduction procedure (the so-called purification), and some specific rank-one matrix decomposition techniques to yield a globally optimal solution. In this paper, we propose several randomized postprocessing methods to output not an approximate solution but a globally optimal solution for some solvable instances of the double-sided QCQP (i.e., instances with a small number of constraints). We illustrate their applicability in robust receive beamforming, radar optimal code design, and broadcast beamforming for multiuser communications. As a byproduct, we derive an alternative (shorter) proof for the Sturm-Zhang rank-one matrix decomposition theorem. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel transmission policy for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted wireless powered sensor network (WPSN). An IRS is deployed to enhance the performance of wireless energy transfer (WET) and wireless information transfer (WIT) by intelligently adjusting phase shifts of each reflecting elements. To achieve its self-sustainability, the IRS needs to collect energy from energy station to support its control circuit operation. Our proposed policy for the considered WPSN is called IRS assisted harvest-then-transmit time switching, which is able to schedule the transmission time slots by switching between energy collection and energy reflection modes. We study the achievable sum throughput of the proposed transmission policy and investigate a joint design of the transmission time slots, the power allocation, as well as the discrete phase shifts of the WET and WIT. This formulates the problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program, which is NP-hard and non-convex. We first relax it to one with continuous phase shifts, and then propose a two-step approach and decompose the original problem into two sub-problems. We solve the first sub-problem with respect to the phase shifts of the WIT in terms of closed-form expression. For the second sub-problem, we consider a special case without the circuit power of each sensor node, the Lagrange dual method and the KKT conditions are applied to derive the optimal closed-form transmission time slots, power allocation, and phase shift of the WET. Then we generalise the case with the circuit power of each sensor node, which can be solved via employing a semi-definite programming relaxation. The optimal discrete phase shifts can be obtained by quantizing the continuous values. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policy and validate the beneficial role of the IRS in comparison to the benchmark schemes.},

@article{Zhao2021a,
abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising new paradigm to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency for future wireless networks by reconfiguring the wireless signal propagation via passive reflection. To reap the promising gains of IRS, channel state information (CSI) is essential, whereas channel estimation errors are inevitable in practice due to limited channel training resources. In this paper, in order to optimize the performance of IRS-aided multiuser communications with imperfect CSI, we propose to jointly design the active transmit precoding at the access point (AP) and passive reflection coefficients of the IRS, each consisting of not only the conventional phase shift and also the newly exploited amplitude variation. First, the achievable rate of each user is derived assuming a practical IRS channel estimation method, which shows that the interference due to CSI errors is intricately related to the AP transmit precoders, the channel training power and the IRS reflection coefficients during both channel training and data transmission. Next, for the single-user case, by combining the benefits of the penalty method, Dinkelbach method and block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) method, a new penalized Dinkelbach-BSUM algorithm is proposed to optimize the IRS reflection coefficients for maximizing the achievable data transmission rate subjected to CSI errors; while for the multiuser case, a new penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is proposed to maximize the users&#x2019; weighted sum-rate. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms as compared to benchmark schemes. In particular, useful insights are drawn to characterize the effect of IRS reflection amplitude control (with/without the conventional phase-shift control) on the system performance under imperfect CSI.},

In this system, a multi-antenna access point (AP) uses transmit beamforming to send both information and energy signals to a set of receivers each for information decoding (ID) or energy harvesting (EH), and a dedicatedly deployed IRS properly controls its reflecting phase shifts to form passive reflection beams for facilitating both ID and EH at receivers. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the (active) information and energy transmit beamforming at the AP together with the (passive) reflective beamforming at the IRS, to maximize the minimum power received at all EH receivers, subject to individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at ID receivers, and the maximum transmit power constraint at the AP. Although the formulated SINR-constrained min-energy maximization problem is highly non-convex, we present an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution by using the techniques of alternating optimization and semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Numerical results show that the proposed IRS-assisted SWIPT system with both information and energy signals achieves significant performance gains over benchmark schemes without IRS deployed and/or without dedicated energy signals used.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study blind channel-and-signal estimation by exploiting the burst-sparse structure of angular-domain propagation channels in massive MIMO systems. The state-of-the-art approach utilizes the structured channel sparsity by sampling the angular-domain channel representation with a uniform angle-sampling grid, a.k.a. virtual channel representation. However, this approach is only applicable to uniform linear arrays and may cause a substantial performance loss due to the mismatch between the virtual representation and the true angle information. To tackle these challenges, we propose a sparse channel representation with a super-resolution sampling grid and a hidden Markovian support. Based on this, we develop a novel approximate inference based blind estimation algorithm to estimate the channel and the user signals simultaneously, with emphasis on the adoption of the expectation-maximization method to learn the angle information. Furthermore, we demonstrate the low-complexity implementation of our algorithm, making use of factor graph and message passing principles to compute the marginal posteriors. Numerical results show that our proposed method significantly reduces the estimation error compared to the state-of-the-art approach under various settings, which verifies the efficiency and robustness of our method.},

abstract = {Backscatter communication is a new wireless communication technology, which can enable battery-free devices to communicate with others by backscattering ambient radio-frequency signals, and therefore has great potential to be deployed in the future Internet of Things (IoT) networks. In the existing related studies, the adopted centralized approach might be not suitable for a large-scale IoT network with sporadic backscatter communication, while the adopted distributed approach ignored the demand of the access point (AP). In this paper, we consider a large-scale IoT network consisting of the legacy Wi-Fi communication and the backscatter communication, and aim to propose an efficient distributed backscatter medium access control protocol that takes into account of the demand of the AP. In our protocol, when the AP has a demand to collect the information of backscatter devices, it enables backscatter devices to contend for the channel with Wi-Fi devices in a separate manner, where the backscatter devices are only allowed to participate in the contention in a limited time period. We then characterize this constrained contention process and develop a theoretical model to analyze the performance of the proposed protocol. With this model, we can exactly express the per-node throughput of Wi-Fi and backscatter devices. Finally, extensive simulations verify that our model is much accurate, and our protocol can outperform the related protocol in terms of both per-node throughput and system throughput.},

abstract = {Starting from Tesla's principles of wireless power transfer a century ago, this critical review outlines recent magneto-inductive research activities on wireless power transfer with the transmission distance greater than the transmitter coil dimension. It summarizes the operating principles of a range of wireless power research into 1) the maximum power transfer and 2) the maximum energy efficiency principles. The differences and the implications of these two approaches are explained in terms of their energy efficiency and transmission distance capabilities. The differences between the system energy efficiency and the transmission efficiency are also highlighted. The review covers the two-coil systems, the four-coil systems, the systems with relay resonators and the wireless domino-resonator systems. Related issues including human exposure issues and reduction of winding resistance are also addressed. The review suggests that the use of the maximum energy efficiency principle in the two-coil systems is suitable for short-range rather than mid-range applications, the use of the maximum power transfer principle in the four-coil systems is good for maximizing the transmission distance, but is under a restricted system energy efficiency (<50%); the use of the maximum energy efficiency principle in relay or domino systems may offer a good compromise for good system energy efficiency and transmission distance on the condition that relay resonators can be placed between the power source and the load. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

To this end, we first study three special cases of the dynamic IRS beamforming,namely user-adaptive IRS beamforming, UL-adaptive IRS beamforming, and static IRS beamforming,by characterizing their optimal performance relationships and proposing corresponding algorithms. Interestingly, it is rigorously proved that the latter two cases achieve the same throughput, thus helping halve the number of IRS phase shifts to be optimized and signalling overhead practically required for UL-adaptive IRS beamforming. Then, we propose a general optimization framework for dynamic IRS beamforming, which is applicable for any given number of IRS phase-shift vectors available. Despite of the non-convexity of the general problem with highly coupled optimization variables, we propose two algorithms to solve it and particularly, the low-complexity algorithm exploits the intrinsic structure of the optimal solution as well as the solutions to the cases with user-adaptive and static IRS beamforming. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, illustrate the practical significance of IRS with dynamic beamforming for spectral and energy efficient WPCNs, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs over various benchmark schemes.},

abstract = {Fractional programming (FP) refers to a family of optimization problems that involve ratio term(s). This two-part paper explores the use of FP in the design and optimization of communication systems. Part I of this paper focuses on FP theory and on solving continuous problems. The main theoretical contribution is a novel quadratic transform technique for tackling the multiple-ratio concave-convex FP problem - in contrast to conventional FP techniques that mostly can only deal with the single-ratio or the max-min-ratio case. Multiple-ratio FP problems are important for the optimization of communication networks, because system-level design often involves multiple signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio terms. This paper considers the applications of FP to solving continuous problems in communication system design, particularly for power control, beamforming, and energy efficiency maximization. These application cases illustrate that the proposed quadratic transform can greatly facilitate the optimization involving ratios by recasting the original nonconvex problem as a sequence of convex problems. This FP-based problem reformulation gives rise to an efficient iterative optimization algorithm with provable convergence to a stationary point. The paper further demonstrates close connections between the proposed FP approach and other well-known algorithms in the literature, such as the fixed-point iteration and the weighted minimum mean-square-error beamforming. The optimization of discrete problems is discussed in Part II of this paper.},

abstract = {By accommodating overlapping transmissions over non-orthogonal resources, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) integrated with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) can boost spectral efficiency and obtain vast diversity for wireless multiuser systems. However, NOMA requires channel state information (CSI) at the receiver for coherent detection, resulting in unaffordable complexity in the channel estimation as the number of users goes large. Add to that, the introduction of massive MIMO makes the channel estimation even more challenging. In this letter, we propose a blind belief propagation (BP) detection for non-coherent NOMA with massive MIMO, where the transmitter of each user first performs differential modulation on PSK symbols, and then spreads its symbols using low-density spreading (LDS); the receiver of base station (BS) employs differential demodulation and then detects all users' symbols using a blind BP detection without knowledge of CSI. Simulation results show that the proposed blind BP detection can not only support the overloaded users, but also achieve BER performance very close to that of point-to-point systems.},

abstract = {—In this paper, we are interested in symbiotic radio networks, in which an Internet-of-Things (IoT) network parasitizes in a primary network to achieve spectrum-, energy-, and infrastructure-efficient communications. Specifically, the BS serves multiple cellular users using time division multiple access (TDMA) and each IoT device is associated with one cellular user for information transmission. We focus on the user association problem, whose objective is to link each IoT device to an appropriate cellular user by maximizing the sum rate of all IoT devices. However, the difficulty in obtaining the full real-time channel information makes it difficult to design an optimal policy for this problem. To overcome this issue, we propose two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, both use the historical information to infer the current information in order to make appropriate decisions. One algorithm, centralized DRL, makes decisions for all IoT devices at one time with global information. The other algorithm, distributed DRL, makes a decision only for one IoT device at one time using local information. Finally, simulation results show that the two DRL algorithms achieve comparable performance as the optimal user association policy which requires perfect real-time information, and the distributed DRL algorithm has the advantage of scalability.},

abstract = {In recent years, ambient backscatter communications have gained a lot of interest as a promising enabling technology for Internet-of-Things and green communications. In ambient backscatter communication systems, battery-less devices are able to transmit information by backscattering ambient RF signals generated by legacy communication systems such as digital TV broadcasting, Wi-Fi, or cellular. This paper is concerned with ambient backscatter communications over legacy cellular OFDM signals. We propose a novel modulation scheme that allows backscattering devices to take advantage of the spectrum structure of ambient OFDM symbols to transmit information. We analyze the error performance of the proposed scheme, provide an exact expression for the error probability, and validate our analysis using Monte-Carlo simulation. We investigate the effects of varying the OFDM symbol size and maximum channel delay spread on the error performance. Our numerical results show that the proposed technique outperforms other techniques available in the literature for backscatter communication over ambient OFDM signals in different scenarios.},

We analyze limitations due to measurement imperfections for measurement-based capacity calculations and keyhole investigations.

Through theoretical and numerical analyses, we present two important results. First, we improve the existing energy detector by calculating the optimal averaging power orders. Second, we take advantage of the early work on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), where the repeating structure of ambient OFDM signals is exploited to cancel out the direct-link interference by using a cyclic prefix, then provide a test statistic in which optimal detection threshold and optimal power order are derived accordingly. The study reveals the inherent limitation of AmBC energy detectors and provides a guidance for achieving optimal power order for a given significance level.},

Existing techniques for channel estimation are prohibitively complex and consume too much power to be integrated into milliwatt- or microwatt-class wirelessly powered devices. We show that power transfer can be optimized using a transponder's backscatter signal alone, without requiring channel estimation and power measurement circuitry on the transponder. A measurement-based proof of concept is presented, illustrating that for any linear backscatter transponder, power optimization based on the backscattered signal is equivalent to local measurement at the mobile device itself. Using an 8×8 MIMO transceiver array to optimize power delivery across 100 randomly chosen locations in our office environment, we observe an average WPT enhancement of 8.1 dB relative to an unoptimized transmitter configuration. Transponders with nonlinear power harvesters can easily be supported with the addition of a single RF switching transistor. {\textcopyright} 2002-2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Radio waves carry both energy and information simultaneously. Nevertheless, radio-frequency (RF) transmissions of these quantities have traditionally been treated separately. Currently, the community is experiencing a paradigm shift in wireless network design, namely, unifying wireless transmission of information and power so as to make the best use of the RF spectrum and radiation as well as the network infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating and energizing. In this paper, we review and discuss recent progress in laying the foundations of the envisioned dual purpose networks by establishing a signal theory and design for wireless information and power transmission (WIPT) and identifying the fundamental tradeoff between conveying information and power wirelessly. We start with an overview of WIPT challenges and technologies, namely, simultaneous WIPT (SWIPT), wirelessly powered communication networks (WPCNs), and wirelessly powered backscatter communication (WPBC). We then characterize energy harvesters and show how WIPT signal and system designs crucially revolve around the underlying energy harvester model. To that end, we highlight three different energy harvester models, namely, one linear model and two nonlinear models, and show how WIPT designs differ for each of them in single-user and multi-user deployments. Topics discussed include rate-energy region characterization, transmitter and receiver architectures, waveform design, modulation, beamforming and input distribution optimizations, resource allocation, and RF spectrum use. We discuss and check the validity of the different energy harvester models and the resulting signal theory and design based on circuit simulations, prototyping, and experimentation. We also point out numerous directions that are promising for future research.},

Through it, malware can wirelessly leak information without making network connections or emitting signals, such as sound, EMR, vibration, etc., that we can feel or are aware of. The covert channel is built on a communication method that we call NICScatter. NICScatter transmitter malware forces mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets or laptops, to reflect surrounding RF signals to covertly convey information. The operation is achieved by controlling the impedance of a device's wireless network interface card (NIC). Importantly, the operation requires no special privileges on current mobile OSs, which allows the malware to stealthily pass sensitive data to an attacker's nearby mobile device, which can then decode the signal and thus effectively gather the guarded data. Our experiments with different mobile devices show that the covert channel can achieve 1.6 bps and transmit as far as 2 meters. In a through-the-wall scenario, it can transmit up to 70 cm.},

In this paper, IRS-assisted single-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication is investigated.

Aiming to improve the system secrecy rate, a design problem for jointly optimizing the base station (BS)'s beamforming and the IRS's reflecting beamforming is formulated considering different quality of service (QoS) requirements and time-varying channel conditions. As the system is highly dynamic and complex, and it is challenging to address the non-convex optimization problem, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based secure beamforming approach is firstly proposed to achieve the optimal beamforming policy against eavesdroppers in dynamic environments. Furthermore, post-decision state (PDS) and prioritized experience replay (PER) schemes are utilized to enhance the learning efficiency and secrecy performance. Specifically, a modified PDS scheme is presented to trace the channel dynamic and adjust the beamforming policy against channel uncertainty accordingly. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed deep PDS-PER learning based secure beamforming approach can significantly improve the system secrecy rate and QoS satisfaction probability in IRS-aided secure communication systems.},

This paper argues that scalar-valued DRCS analysis is unnecessarily limiting because of the inherent coherence of the backscatter link and the complex-valued nature of load-dependent antenna-mode scattering from an RFID tag. Considering modulated backscatter in terms of complex-valued scattered fields opens the possibility of quadrature modulation of the backscatter channel. When compared with binary amplitude shift keying (ASK) or phase shift keying (PSK) based RFID systems, which transmit 1 bit of data per symbol period, and thus 1 bit per on-chip clock oscillator period, tags employing vector backscatter modulation can transmit more than 1 bit per symbol period. This increases the data rate for a given on-chip symbol clock rate leading to reduced on-chip power consumption and extended read range. Alternatively, tags employing an -ary modulator can achieve higher data throughput at essentially the same dc power consumption as a tag employing binary ASK or PSK. In contrast to the binary ASK or PSK backscatter modulation employed by passive and semipassive UHF RFID tags, such as tags compliant with the widely used ISO18000-6c standard, this paper explores a novel CMOS-compatible method for generating -ary quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) backscatter modulation. A new method is presented for designing an inductorless -ary QAM backscatter modulator using only an array of switched resistances and capacitances. Device-level simulation and measurements of a four-state phase shift keying (4-PSK)/four-state quadrature amplitude modulated (4-QAM) modulator are provided for a semipassive (battery-assisted) tag operating in the 850-950-MHz band. This first prototype modulator transmits 4-PSK/4-QAM at a symbol rate of 200 kHz and a bit rate of 400 kb/s at a static power dissipation of only 115 nW. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Radiating wireless power transfer (WPT) brings forth the possibility to cost-efficiently charge wireless devices without requiring a wiring infrastructure. As such, it is expected to play a key role in the deployment of limited-battery communicating devices, as part of the 6G enabled Internet-of-Everything (IoE) vision. To date, radiating WPT technologies are mainly studied and designed assuming that the devices are located in the far-field region of the power radiating antenna, resulting in a relatively low energy transfer efficiency. However, with the transition of 6G systems to mmWave frequencies combined with the usage of large-scale antennas, future WPT devices are likely to operate in the radiating near-field (Fresnel) region. In this article, we provide an overview of the opportunities and challenges which arise from radiating near-field WPT. In particular, we discuss about the possibility to realize beam focusing in near-field radiating conditions, and highlight its possible implications for WPT in future {IoE} networks. Besides, we overview some of the design challenges and research directions which arise from this emerging paradigm, including its simultaneous operation with wireless communications, radiating waveform considerations, hardware aspects, and operation with typical antenna architectures.},

An atomic norm minimization approach is proposed to exactly recover the unobserved samples and identify the unknown frequencies, which is then reformulated as an exact semidefinite program. Even with this continuous dictionary, it is shown that O(s log s log n) random samples are sufficient to guarantee exact frequency localization with high probability, provided the frequencies are well separated.

abstract = {In a multi-user multi-antenna Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) network, the transmitter sends information to the Information Receivers (IRs) and energy to Energy Receivers (ERs) concurrently. A conventional approach is based on Multi-User Linear Precoding (MU-LP) where each IR directly decodes the intended stream by fully treating the interference from other IRs and ERs as noise. In this paper, we investigate the application of linearly-precoded Rate-Splitting (RS) in Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) SWIPT Broadcast Channel (BC). By splitting the messages of IRs into private and common parts and encoding the common parts into a common stream decoded by all IRs, RS manages the interference dynamically. The precoders are designed such that the Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) of IRs is maximized under the total transmit power constraint and the sum energy constraint for ERs. Numerical results show that the proposed RS-assisted strategy provides a better rate-energy tradeoff in MISO SWIPT BC. Under a sum energy constraint of ERs, RS-assisted strategy achieves better WSR performance of IRs than MU-LP and NOMA in a wide range of IR and ER deployments. Hence, we draw the conclusion that RS is superior for downlink SWIPT networks.},

abstract = {To cope with the explosive traffic growth of next-generation wireless communications, it is necessary to design next-generation multiple access techniques that can provide higher spectral efficiency as well as larger-scale connectivity. As a promising candidate, power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been widely studied. In conventional power-domain NOMA, multiple users are multiplexed in the same time and frequency band by different preset power levels, which, however, may limit the spectral efficiency under practical finite alphabet inputs. Inspired by the concept of spatial modulation, we propose to solve this problem by encoding extra information bits into the power levels, and exploit different signal constellations to help the receiver distinguish between them. To convey this idea, termed power selection (PS)-NOMA, clearly, we consider a simple downlink two-user NOMA system with finite input constellations. Assuming maximum-likelihood detection, we derive closed-form approximate bit error ratio (BER) expressions for both users. The achievable rates of both users are also derived in closed form. Simulation results verify the analysis and show that the proposed PS-NOMA outperforms conventional NOMA in terms of BER and achievable rate.},

abstract = {Piezo-acoustic bacskcatter (PAB) is a recently-introduced ultra-low-power underwater communication technology. In contrast to traditional underwater acoustic modems, which need to generate power-consuming carrier signals, PAB nodes communicate by simply reflecting (i.e., backscattering) existing acoustic signals in the environment. This reflection-based approach enables them to communicate at net-zero power but also imposes significant constraints on their throughput and modulation schemes. We present PAB-QAM, the first underwater backscatter design capable of achieving higher-order modulation. PAB-QAM exploits the electro-mechanical coupling property of piezoelectric transducers to modulate their reflection coefficients. Specifically, by strategically employing reactive circuit components (inductors), we demonstrate how PAB-QAM nodes can modulate the phase and amplitude of acoustic reflections and realize higher-order and spectrally-efficient modulation schemes such as QAM. We designed and built a prototype of PAB-QAM and empirically evaluated it underwater. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that PAB-QAM can double the throughput of underwater backscatter without requiring additional power, spectrum, or cost. Looking ahead, such increased throughput paves way for various subsea IoT applications in ocean exploration, underwater climate monitoring, and marine life sensing.},

abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the convergence of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for minimizing a nonconvex and possibly nonsmooth objective function, ϕ(x, {\ldots} , xp, y) , subject to coupled linear equality constraints. Our ADMM updates each of the primal variables x, {\ldots} , xp, y, followed by updating the dual variable. We separate the variable y from xi's as it has a special role in our analysis. The developed convergence guarantee covers a variety of nonconvex functions such as piecewise linear functions, ℓq quasi-norm, Schatten-q quasi-norm (0 < q< 1), minimax concave penalty (MCP), and smoothly clipped absolute deviation penalty. It also allows nonconvex constraints such as compact manifolds (e.g., spherical, Stiefel, and Grassman manifolds) and linear complementarity constraints. Also, the x-block can be almost any lower semi-continuous function. By applying our analysis, we show, for the first time, that several ADMM algorithms applied to solve nonconvex models in statistical learning, optimization on manifold, and matrix decomposition are guaranteed to converge. Our results provide sufficient conditions for ADMM to converge on (convex or nonconvex) monotropic programs with three or more blocks, as they are special cases of our model. ADMM has been regarded as a variant to the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM). We present a simple example to illustrate how ADMM converges but ALM diverges with bounded penalty parameter $\beta$. Indicated by this example and other analysis in this paper, ADMM might be a better choice than ALM for some nonconvex nonsmooth problems, because ADMM is not only easier to implement, it is also more likely to converge for the concerned scenarios.},

To maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of IRs, the transmit precoding (TPC) matrices of the BS and passive phase shift matrix of the IRS should be jointly optimized. To tackle this challenging optimization problem, we first adopt the classic block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm for decoupling the original optimization problem into several subproblems and alternatively optimize the TPC matrices and the phase shift matrix. For each subproblem, we provide a low-complexity iterative algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of each subproblem. The BCD algorithm is rigorously proved to converge to the KKT point of the original problem. We also conceive a feasibility checking method to study its feasibility. Our extensive simulation results confirm that employing IRSs in SWIPT beneficially enhances the system performance and the proposed BCD algorithm converges rapidly, which is appealing for practical applications.},

The MIMO SWIPT design is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem in which system sum rate is optimized considering per-user harvesting constraints. Two different approaches are proposed. The first approach is based on a classical gradient-based method for constrained optimization. The second approach is based on difference of convex (DC) programming. The idea behind this approach is to obtain a convex function that approximates the nonconvex objective and, then, solve a series of convex subproblems that, eventually, will provide a (locally) optimum solution of the general nonconvex problem. The solution obtained from the proposed approach is compared to the classical block-diagonalization (BD) strategy, typically used to solve the nonconvex multiuser MIMO network by forcing no inter-user interference. Simulation results show that the proposed approach improves both the system sum rate and the power harvested by users simultaneously. In terms of computational time, the proposed DC programming outperforms the classical gradient methods.},

However, in recent years, attention has been paid to the waveform design for wireless power transmission. It has been found that signals featuring a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) can provide efficiency improvement when compared with CW signals. A number of approaches have been proposed, such as multisines/multicarrier orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) signals, chaotic signals, harmonicsignals, ultrawideband (UWB) signals, intermittent CW (ICW) signals, or white-noise signals. This article reviews these techniques with a focus on multisines/multicarrier signals, harmonic signals, and chaotic signals. A theoretical explanation for efficiency improvement is provided and accompanied by experimental results.

abstract = {In this paper, the problem of joint mode switching and power adaptation is studied for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) over a fading channel. The receiver dynamically switches between information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) modes while the transmitter dynamically adapts the transmit power. Considering the nonlinearity of practical EH circuits, a realistic nonlinear EH model is adopted rather than the idealistic linear EH model. To characterize the ultimate performance tradeoff between ID and EH, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the average harvested energy under the constraints on the average achievable rate and the average transmit power, which is a nonconvex and combinatorial problem. To solve this problem, first, the optimal power adaptation scheme for the nonlinear EH receiver that operates only in the EH mode is proposed. Using this scheme, the jointly optimal solution for the mode switching and power adaptation is then derived. By comparing the obtained results to the existing results, various useful and interesting insights into the optimized SWIPT system with nonlinear EH are presented. An important insight into the impact of nonlinear EH is that, to exploit the high energy conversion efficiency of the nonlinear circuit, the EH mode has to be selected only in the moderate range of channel gains. Also, in the EH mode, the power has to be adapted to the short-term power threshold only for the moderate channel gains.},

Interestingly, we prove that in both the sum-rate and energy efficiency maximization problems, network-NOMA can be equivalently transformed to a virtual network-OMA system, where the effective channel gain of these virtual OMA users are obtained in closed-form. Then, the latter problems are solved by using very fast water-filling and Dinkelbach algorithms, respectively. The equivalent transformation of NOMA to the virtual OMA system brings new insights, which are discussed throughout the paper. Extensive numerical results are provided to show the performance gap between fully SC-SIC, NOMA, and OMA in terms of system outage probability, BS's power consumption, users sum-rate, and system energy efficiency.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider a multi-user device-to-device network capable of harvesting energy from radio frequency (RF) signals. We assume that each user has a dual-mode radio architecture and can operate in either conventional active RF communications or passive backscatter communications. In the latter, the data transmission relies on the reflection of ambient RF signals. We capitalize the fact that the two communications technologies can complement each other in a hybrid radio network, by proposing the passive relaying scheme for active RF communications. Specifically, each active RF radio is allocated a fixed time slot for its data transmission. It is also assisted by a set of passive radios via backscattering the RF signals of the active radio. Though passive relaying is energy efficient as it consumes minuscule amount of energy in backscatter communications, it indeed competes the channel time that can be used by the passive radios to harvest RF energy. We propose a game-theoretic approach to balance energy harvesting and relaying performance, by allowing each passive radio to iteratively optimize its reflection coefficients. The simulation results verify that the passive relaying scheme significantly enhances the sum throughput of a hybrid radio network.},

abstract = {In this paper, resource allocation for a multi-carrier uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system is studied. Unlike the existing works on multi-carrier uplink NOMA, in which each user is assumed to access only one subcarrier, we consider a more general scenario where the number of subcarriers allocated to a single user is not constrained. We first aim to maximize the system's sum rate, which requires selecting the appropriate subcarriers for each user and distribute the transmission power. The formulated non-convex problem is transformed into a convex one, and further, an optimal and low-complexity iterative water-filling solution is proposed. Nonetheless, it is shown that maximum transmit power is employed by each user to maximize the sum rate. Motivated by the fact that the users are power constrained, the energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is also studied. Based on fractional programming, the EE maximization problem is transformed into a series of sum rate maximization subproblems, and the proposed iterative water-filling solution is applied to each subproblem. The proposed schemes are compared with other NOMA-based and orthogonal multiple access based algorithms, and its superiority is fully validated.},

abstract = {Code-division multiple access (CDMA) is the basis of a family of advanced air interfaces in current and future generation networks. The benefits promised by CDMA have not been fully realized partly due to the prohibitive complexity of optimal detection and decoding of many users communicating simultaneously using the same frequency band. From both theoretical and practical perspectives, this paper advocates a new paradigm of CDMA with sparse spreading sequences, which enables near-optimal multiuser detection using belief propagation (BP) with low-complexity. The scheme is in part inspired by capacity-approaching low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and the success of iterative decoding techniques. Specifically, it is shown that BP-based detection is optimal in the large-system limit under many practical circumstances, which is a unique advantage of sparsely spread CDMA systems. Moreover, it is shown that, from the viewpoint of an individual user, the CDMA channel is asymptotically equivalent to a scalar Gaussian channel with some degradation in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The degradation factor, known as the multiuser efficiency, can be determined from a fixed-point equation. The results in this paper apply to a broad class of sparse, semi-regular CDMA systems with arbitrary input and power distribution. Numerical results support the theoretical findings for systems of moderate size, which further demonstrate the appeal of sparse spreading in practical applications. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {It is well known that the maximum amount of power in an electrical or electronic system can be transferred to a load when its impedance is the complex conjugate of the source impedance, although, the power transfer efficiency is only 50%. Is this fact true for a radio system, as well? The question has existed for decades. In this article, the equivalent circuits of antenna systems are reexamined. It is demonstrated that classical equivalent circuit models based on the Thvenin and Norton theorems are not suitable for a receiving antenna system since the antenna cannot be simply approximated by a voltage or current source. A constant power source is required but not readily available. Thus, two new general power source models are introduced and examined. It is found that they may be suitable for a transmitting antenna system but not accurate enough for a receiving antenna when the antenna loss is taken into account. A novel special constant power source model is therefore proposed and shown to accurately simulate the behavior of a receiving antenna. When the load impedance is the complex conjugate of the antenna impedance, maximum power is obtained, and the power transfer efficiency is simultaneously maximized (up to 100% if the antenna system is lossless).},

The base station divides the set of users into disjunct pairs and assigns the available resources to these pairs. The combinatorial problem of user pairing to achieve the maximum sum rate is analyzed in the large system limit for various scenarios, and some optimum and sub-optimum algorithms with a polynomial-time complexity are proposed. In the first scenario, 2M users and the base station have a single-antenna and communicate over M subcarriers. The performance of optimum pairing is derived for M and shown to be superior to random pairing and orthogonal multiple access techniques. In the second setting, a novel NOMA scheme for a multi-antenna base station and single carrier communication is proposed. In this case, the users need not be aware of the pairing strategy. Furthermore, the proposed NOMA scheme is generalized to multi-antenna users. It is shown that for the considered power allocation scheme, random and optimum user pairing perform similarly in the large system limit, but optimum pairing is significantly better in finite dimensions. It is shown that NOMA with the proposed user pairing scheme outperforms a previously proposed NOMA with signal alignment.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have the potential to transform wireless communication channels into smart reconfigurable propagation environments. To realize this new paradigm, the passive IRSs have to be large, especially for communication in far-field scenarios, so that they can compensate for the large end-to-end path-loss, which is caused by the multiplication of the individual path-losses of the transmitter-to-IRS and IRS-to-receiver channels. However, optimizing a large number of sub-wavelength IRS elements imposes a significant challenge for online transmission. To address this issue, in this paper, we develop a physics-based model and a scalable optimization framework for large IRSs. The basic idea is to partition the IRS unit cells into several subsets, referred to as tiles, model the impact of each tile on the wireless channel, and then optimize each tile in two stages, namely an offline design stage and an online optimization stage. For physics-based modeling, we borrow concepts from the radar literature, model each tile as an anomalous reflector, and derive its impact on the wireless channel for a given phase shift by solving the corresponding integral equations for the electric and magnetic vector fields. In the offline design stage, the IRS unit cells of each tile are jointly designed for the support of different transmission modes, where each transmission mode effectively corresponds to a given configuration of the phase shifts that the unit cells of the tile apply to an impinging electromagnetic wave. In the online optimization stage, the best transmission mode of each tile is selected such that a desired quality-of-service (QoS) criterion is maximized. We consider an exemplary downlink system and study the minimization of the base station (BS) transmit power subject to QoS constraints for the users. Since the resulting mixed-integer programming problem for joint optimization of the BS beamforming vectors and the tile transmission modes is non-convex, we derive two efficient suboptimal solutions, which are based on alternating optimization and a greedy approach, respectively. We show that the proposed modeling and optimization framework can be used to efficiently optimize large IRSs comprising thousands of unit cells.},

abstract = {Ambient Backscatter Communication (AmBC) is an emerging communication technology enabling green Internet-of-Things deployments. The widespread acceptance of this paradigm is limited by the low Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) of the signal impinging on the receiver antenna due to the strong direct path interference and unknown ambient signal. The adverse impact of these two factors can be mitigated by using non-coherent multi-antenna receivers, which are known to require a higher SINR to reach the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) performance of coherent receivers. However, considering the unknown ambient signal, unknown location of AmBC tags, and varying channel conditions, coherent receivers for AmBC systems are rarely studied in literature. In this paper, a coherent multi-antenna receiver, which requires no prior information of the ambient signal for decoding the Binary-Phase-shift-Keying (BPSK) modulated signal, is presented. The performance of the proposed receiver is compared with an ideal coherent receiver that has perfect phase information, and also with the performance of a non-coherent receiver, which assumes distributions for ambient signal and phase offset caused by the excess length of the backscatter path. Comparative simulation results show the designed receiver can achieve the same BER performance of the ideal coherent receiver with 1-dB more SINR, which corresponds to 5-dB or more gain with respect to non-coherent reception of On-Off-Keying modulated signals. Variation in the detection performance with the tag location shows that the coverage area is in the close vicinity of the transmitter and a larger region around the receiver, which is consistent with the theoretical results.},

abstract = {Energy harvesting is a promising solution to prolong the operation of energy-constrained wireless networks. In particular, scavenging energy from ambient radio signals, namely wireless energy harvesting (WEH), has recently drawn significant attention. In this paper, we consider a point-to-point wireless link over the narrowband flat-fading channel subject to time-varying co-channel interference. It is assumed that the receiver has no fixed power supplies and thus needs to replenish energy opportunistically via WEH from the unintended interference and/or the intended signal sent by the transmitter. We further assume a single-antenna receiver that can only decode information or harvest energy at any time due to the practical circuit limitation. Therefore, it is important to investigate when the receiver should switch between the two modes of information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), based on the instantaneous channel and interference condition. In this paper, we derive the optimal mode switching rule at the receiver to achieve various trade-offs between wireless information transfer and energy harvesting. Specifically, we determine the minimum transmission outage probability for delay-limited information transfer and the maximum ergodic capacity for no-delay-limited information transfer versus the maximum average energy harvested at the receiver, which are characterized by the boundary of so-called "outage-energy" region and "rate-energy" region, respectively. Moreover, for the case when the channel state information (CSI) is known at the transmitter, we investigate the joint optimization of transmit power control, information and energy transfer scheduling, and the receiver's mode switching. The effects of circuit energy consumption at the receiver on the achievable rate-energy trade-offs are also characterized. Our results provide useful guidelines for the efficient design of emerging wireless communication systems powered by opportunistic WEH. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

These surfaces consist of many passive elements of metamaterials whose impedance can be controllable to change the characteristics of wireless signals impinging on them. Channel estimation is a critical task when it comes to the control of a large RIS when having a channel with a large number of multipath components. In this paper, we propose novel channel estimation schemes for different RIS-assisted massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configurations. The proposed methods exploit spatial correlation characteristics at both the base station and the planar RISs, and other statistical characteristics of multi-specular fading in a mobile environment. Moreover, a novel heuristic for phase-shift selection at the RISs is developed. For the RIS-assisted massive MIMO, a new receive combining method and a fixed-point algorithm, which solves the max-min fairness power control optimally, are proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed uplink RIS-aided framework improves the spectral efficiency of the cell-edge mobile user equipments substantially in comparison to a conventional single-cell massive MIMO system. The impact of several channel effects are studied to gain insight about which RIS configuration is preferable and when the channel estimation is necessary to boost the spectral efficiency.},

In the proposed structure, graphene is utilized as a cross patch FSS, which is low-profile and tunable. The FSS structure shows a wide stop-band (-15 dB) from 1.1 THz to 1.7 THz. By inserting the FSS structure between the elements of the nano-antenna array, a high isolation of -25 dB with a 15 dB fall is achieved, which indicates that mutual decoupling effects are suppressed for both two-element and four-element arrays. The radiation patterns are given to confirm that the proposed FSS structure can improve the performance of multi-band THz antenna arrays with negligible influence on the nano-antenna radiation performance. Finally, it is asymptotically shown that the mutual coupling experienced by the nano-antenna with the FSS structure is negligible even in the presence of very large number of closely integrated elements.},

In particular, this paper considers millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems, which are principal components of 5G and beyond. These systems face two important challenges: (i) the large training overhead associated with selecting the optimal beam and (ii) the reliability challenge due to the high sensitivity to link blockages. Interestingly, most of the devices that employ mmWave arrays will likely also use cameras, such as 5G phones, self-driving vehicles, and virtual/augmented reality headsets. Therefore, we investigate the potential gains of employing cameras at the mmWave base stations and leveraging their visual data to help overcome the beam selection and blockage prediction challenges. To do that, this paper exploits computer vision and deep learning tools to predict mmWave beams and blockages directly from the camera RGB images and the sub-6GHz channels. The experimental results reveal interesting insights into the effectiveness of such solutions. For example, the deep learning model is capable of achieving over 90\% beam prediction accuracy, which only requires snapping a shot of the scene and zero overhead.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study a new intelligent refracting surface (IRS)-assisted high-mobility communication with the IRS deployed in a high-speed moving vehicle to assist its passenger's communication with a static base station (BS) on the roadside. The vehicle's high Doppler frequency results in a fast fading channel between the BS and the passenger/user, which renders channel estimation for the IRS with a large number of refracting elements a more challenging task as compared to the conventional case with low-mobility users only. In order to mitigate the Doppler effect and reap the full IRS passive beamforming gain with low training overhead, we propose a new and efficient transmission protocol to execute channel estimation and IRS refraction design for data transmission. Specifically, by exploiting the quasi-static channel between the IRS and user both moving at the same high speed, we first estimate the cascaded BS-IRS-user channel with the Doppler effect compensated. Then, we estimate the instantaneous BS-user fast fading channel (without IRS refraction) and tune the IRS refraction over time accordingly to align the cascaded channel with the BS-user direct channel, thus maximizing the IRS's passive beamforming gain as well as converting their combined channel from fast to slow fading. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation scheme and passive beamforming design as compared to various benchmark schemes.},

abstract = {In this paper, the problem of maximizing the wireless users' sum-rate for uplink rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) communications is studied. We aim to maximize the sum-rate with proportional rate constraints by adjusting the users' transmit power and the BS's decoding order. The original maximization problem with transmit power and decoding order variables can be transformed into a problem with only the rate splitting variable. Then, the optimal rate splitting of each user is determined. Given the optimal rate splitting of each user and a decoding order, the optimal transmit power of each user is calculated. Next, the optimal decoding order is determined by an exhaustive search method. To further reduce the complexity of the optimization algorithm used for sum-rate maximization in RSMA, a user pairing based algorithm is introduced. For comparisons, the optimal sum-rate maximizing solutions with proportional rate constraints are obtained for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), and time division multiple access (TDMA). Simulation results show that RSMA can achieve up to 10.0%, 22.2%, and 81.2% gains in terms of sum-rate compared to NOMA, FDMA, and TDMA.},

abstract = {Energy harvesting for wireless communication networks is a new paradigm that allows terminals to recharge their batteries from external energy sources in the surrounding environment. A promising energy harvesting technology is wireless power transfer where terminals harvest energy from electromagnetic radiation. Thereby, the energy may be harvested opportunistically from ambient electromagnetic sources or from sources that intentionally transmit electromagnetic energy for energy harvesting purposes. A particularly interesting and challenging scenario arises when sources perform simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), as strong signals not only increase power transfer but also interference. This article provides an overview of SWIPT systems with a particular focus on the hardware realization of rectenna circuits and practical techniques that achieve SWIPT in the domains of time, power, antennas, and space. The article also discusses the benefits of a potential integration of SWIPT technologies in modern communication networks in the context of resource allocation and cooperative cognitive radio networks.},

abstract = {The ever increasing proliferation of wireless objects and consistent connectivity demands are creating significant challenges for battery-constrained wireless devices. The vision of massive IoT, involving billions of smart objects to be connected to the cellular network, needs to address the problem of uninterrupted power consumption while taking advantage of emerging high-frequency 5G communications. The problem of limited battery power motivates us to utilize radio frequency (RF) signals as the energy source for battery-free communications in next-generation wireless networks. Backscatter communication (BackCom) makes it possible to harvest energy from incident RF signals and reflect back parts of the same signals while modulating the data. Ambient BackCom (Amb-BackCom) is a type of BackCom that can harvest energy from nearby WiFi, TV, and cellular RF signals to modulate information. The objective of this article is to review BackCom as a solution to the limited battery life problem and enable future battery-free communications for combating the energy issues for devices in emerging wireless networks. We first highlight the energy constraint in existing wireless communications. We then investigate BackCom as a practical solution to the limited battery life problem. Subsequently, in order to take the advantages of omnipresent radio waves, we elaborate BackCom tag architecture and various types of BackCom. To understand encoding and data extraction, we demonstrate signal processing aspects that cover channel coding, interference, decoding, and signal detection schemes. Moreover, we also describe BackCom communication modes, modulation schemes, and multiple access techniques to accommodate maximum users with high throughput. Similarly, to mitigate the increased network energy, adequate data and power transfer schemes for BackCom are elaborated, in addition to reliability, security, and range extension. Finally, we highlight BackCom applications with existing research challenges and future directions for next-generation 5G wireless networks.},

In this paper, we leverage the BM by increasing its down-link (from reader to tag) and up-link (from tag to reader) ranges. We propose two active two-way BM tag configurations, named parallel and series. For both configurations, we use active loads in the tag modulators to maximize the BM range and implement the desired backscattered constellation, subject to no data loss in the down-link path. Contrary to most existing BM studies, we use Thevenin/Norton equivalent circuit, only to calculate the received power at tag, while we derive the tag backscattered power using the antenna scatterer theorem. Moreover, we obtain a closed-form expression of the average bit error probability (BEP) at the reader in Rician fading channel environment for both tag configurations. We compare the proposed active BM tags with the conventional passive BM tags. The simulation results prove that for an average BEP equal to 10-4, an SNR improvement of up to 19 and 24 dB can be achieved for parallel and series configurations, respectively.},

We transform the considered non-convex objective function from sum-of-ratios form into an equivalent objective function in subtractive form, which enables the derivation of an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration, a rank-constrained semidefinite program (SDP) is solved optimally by SDP relaxation.

To begin with, the achievable data rates for multicast and unicast services are derived in closed form, as well as the received radio frequency (RF) power at each UE. Based on the analytical results, a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization problem for energy efficiency (EE) maximization is formulated, which is however a challenging fractional programming problem with complex constraints. To suit the massive access setting, a first-order algorithm is developed to find both initial feasible point and the nearly optimal solution. Moreover, an accelerated algorithm is designed to improve the convergence speed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed first-order algorithms can achieve almost the same EE as that of second-order approaches yet with much lower computational complexity, which provides insight into the superiority of the proposed algorithms for massive access in cell-free massive MIMO systems.},

The number of AP antennas is significantly larger than the number of users. The system is not partitioned into cells and each user is served by all APs simultaneously. The simplest linear precoding schemes are conjugate beamforming and zero-forcing. Max-min power control provides equal throughput to all users and is considered in this paper. Surprisingly, under max-min power control, most APs are found to transmit at less than full power. The zero-forcing precoder significantly outperforms conjugate beamforming. For zero-forcing, a near-optimal power control algorithm is developed that is considerably simpler than exact max-min power control. An alternative to cell-free systems is small-cell operation in which each user is served by only one AP for which power optimization algorithms are also developed. Cell-free Massive MIMO is shown to provide five-to ten-fold improvement in 95%-likely per-user throughput over small-cell operation.},

Different from conventional orthogonal multiple access technologies, NOMA can accommodate much more users via nonorthogonal resource allocation.

abstract = {This paper introduces a new solution to improve the performance for secondary systems in radio frequency (RF) powered cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In a conventional RF-powered CRN, the secondary system works based on the harvest-then-transmit protocol. That is, the secondary transmitter (ST) harvests energy from primary signals and then uses the harvested energy to transmit data to its secondary receiver (SR). However, with this protocol, the performance of the secondary system is much dependent on the amount of harvested energy as well as the primary channel activity, e.g., idle and busy periods. Recently, ambient backscatter communication has been introduced, which enables the ST to transmit data to the SR by backscattering ambient signals. Therefore, it is potential to be adopted in the RF-powered CRN. We investigate the performance of RF-powered CRNs with ambient backscatter communication over two scenarios, i.e., overlay and underlay CRNs. For each scenario, we formulate and solve the optimization problem to maximize the overall transmission rate of the secondary system. Numerical results show that by incorporating such two techniques, the performance of the secondary system can be improved significantly compared with the case when the ST performs either harvest-then-transmit or ambient backscatter technique.},

Many approximations exist that are based on approximating a sum of lognormal random variables as another lognormal random variable. A new method for calculating an approximation to a lognormal sum distribution, based on curve fitting on lognormal probability paper is introduced in this paper. Accurate, simple closed-form approximations to distributions and densities of lognormal sum random variables are presented.},

abstract = {Symbiotic radio is a promising technology to achieve spectrum- and energy-efficient wireless communications, where the secondary backscatter device (BD) leverages not only the spectrum but also the power of the primary signals for its own information transmission. In return, the primary communication link can be enhanced by the additional multipaths created by the BD. This is known as the mutualism relationship of symbiotic radio. However, as the backscattering link is much weaker than the direct link due to double attenuations, the improvement of the primary link brought by one single BD is extremely limited. To address this issue and enable full mutualism of symbiotic radio, in this paper, we study symbiotic radio with massive number of BDs. For symbiotic radio multiple access channel (MAC) with successive interference cancellation (SIC), we first derive the achievable rate of both the primary and secondary communications, based on which a receive beamforming optimization problem is formulated and solved. Furthermore, considering the asymptotic regime of massive number of BDs, closed-form expressions are derived for the primary and the secondary communication rates, both of which are shown to be increasing functions of the number of BDs. This thus demonstrates that the mutualism relationship of symbiotic radio can be fully exploited with massive BD access.},

However, developing straightforward and tractable electromagnetic (EM) models that are suitable for IRS aided communication modeling remains an open issue. In this paper, we address this issue and derive communication models by using rigorous scattering parameter network analysis. We also propose new IRS architectures based on group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks, which are more general and more efficient than conventional single connected reconfigurable impedance network. In addition, the scaling law of the received signal power of an IRS aided system with reconfigurable impedance networks is also derived. Compared with the single connected reconfigurable impedance network, our group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance network can increase the received signal power by up to 62%, or maintain the same received signal power with a number of IRS elements reduced by up to 21%. We also investigate the proposed architecture in deployments with distance-dependent pathloss and Rician fading channel, and show that the proposed group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks outperform the single connected case by up to 34% and 48%, respectively.},

To this end, the fractional programming (FP)-based quadratic transform is employed to reformulate the non-convex SINR constraint of the original problem into a tractable quadratic form, which contains an estimate of the CSI error vector as a parameter. Taking advantage of the fact that the zero duality gap holds for the non-convex quadratic problems, a closed-form expression for an estimate of the CSI error vector is derived, completing the formulation. Finally, a novel iterative algorithm based on both the herein derived CSI error vector and the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique is contributed, which is shown to capable of efficiently solving the constrained min-power problem. Simulation results are given which illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, which is found to sacrifice only small quantities of transmit power in return for a substantial increase in robustness against CSI imperfection.},

abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new and revolutionizing technology for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless networks. By leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect radio-frequency (RF) signals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS can achieve high passive beamforming gains, which are particularly appealing for improving the efficiency of RF-based wireless power transfer. Motivated by the above, we study in this paper an IRS-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. Specifically, a set of IRSs are deployed to assist in the information/power transfer from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs), respectively. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP via jointly optimizing its transmit precoders and the reflect phase shifts at all IRSs, subject to the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints at all users, namely, the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at IUs and the energy harvesting constraints at EUs. However, this optimization problem is non-convex with intricately coupled variables, for which the existing alternating optimization approach is shown to be inefficient as the number of QoS constraints increases. To tackle this challenge, we first apply proper transformations on the QoS constraints and then propose an efficient iterative algorithm by applying the penalty-based optimization method. Moreover, by exploiting the short-range coverage of IRS, we further propose a more computationally efficient algorithm by optimizing the phase shifts at all IRSs in parallel. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of employing multiple IRSs for enhancing the performance of SWIPT systems as well as the significant performance gains achieved by our proposed algorithms over benchmark schemes. The impact of IRS on the transmitter/receiver design for SWIPT is also unveiled.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications and design aspects of the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in the future wireless networks. Conventionally, the network optimization has been limited to transmission control at two endpoints, i.e., end users and network controller. The fading wireless channel is uncontrollable and becomes one of the main limiting factors for performance improvement. The IRS is composed of a large array of scattering elements, which can be individually configured to generate additional phase shifts to the signal reflections. Hence, it can actively control the signal propagation properties in favor of signal reception, and thus realize the notion of a smart radio environment. As such, the IRS's phase control combined with the conventional transmission control can potentially bring performance gain compared to the conventional wireless networks without using the IRS. In this survey, we first introduce basic concepts of the IRS and the realizations of its reconfigurability. Then, we focus on applications of the IRS in wireless communications. We overview different performance metrics and analytical approaches to characterize the performance improvement of IRS-assisted wireless networks. To exploit the performance gain, we discuss the joint optimization of the IRS's phase control and the transceivers' transmission control in different network design problems, e.g., rate maximization and power minimization problems. Furthermore, we extend the discussion of IRS-assisted wireless networks to some emerging wireless applications. Finally, we highlight important practical challenges and future research directions of realizing IRS-assisted wireless communications in beyond 5G networks.},

abstract = {The explosion of the number of low-power devices in the next decades calls for a re-thinking of wireless network design, namely, unifying wireless transmission of information and power so as to make the best use of the RF spectrum, radiation, and infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating and energizing. This paper provides a novel learning-based approach towards such wireless network design. To that end, a parametric model of a practical energy harvester, accounting for various sources of nonlinearities, is proposed using a nonlinear regression algorithm applied over collected real data. Relying on the proposed model, the learning problem of modulation design for Simultaneous Wireless Information-Power Transmission (SWIPT) over a point-to-point link is studied. Joint optimization of the transmitter and the receiver is implemented using Neural Network (NN)-based autoencoders. The results reveal that by increasing the receiver power demand, the baseband transmit modulation constellation converges to an On-Off keying signalling. Utilizing the observations obtained via learning, an algorithmic SWIPT modulation design is proposed. It is observed via numerical results that the performance loss of the proposed modulations are negligible compared to the ones obtained from learning. Extension of the studied problem to learning modulation design for multi-user SWIPT scenarios and coded modulation design for point-to-point SWIPT are considered. The major conclusion of this work is to utilize learning-based results to design non learning-based algorithms, which perform as well. In particular, inspired by the results obtained via learning, an algorithmic approach for coded modulation design is proposed, which performs very close to its learning counterparts, and is significantly superior due to its high real-time adaptability to new system design parameters.},

A fast ion collective Thomson scattering (CTS) diagnostic using gyrotrons operated at 60 GHz will meet the requirements for spatially and temporally resolved measurements of the velocity distributions of confined fast alphas in ITER by evaluating the scattered radiation (CTS signal). While a receiver antenna on the low field side of the tokamak, resolving near perpendicular (to the magnetic field) velocity components, has been enabled, an additional antenna on the high field side (HFS) would enable measurements of near parallel (to the magnetic field) velocity components. A compact design solution for the proposed mirror system on the HFS is presented. The HFS CTS antenna is located behind the blankets and views the plasma through the gap between two blanket modules. The viewing gap has been modified to dimensions 30×500 mm2 to optimize the CTS signal. A 1:1 mock-up of the HFS mirror system was built. Measurements of the beam characteristics for millimeter-waves at 60 GHz used in the mock-up agree well with the modeling. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the waveform and passive beamforming design for intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided wireless power transfer (WPT). Generalized multi-user and low complexity single-user algorithms are derived based on alternating optimization (AO) framework to maximize the weighted sum output DC current, subject to transmit power constraints and passive beamforming phases unit modulus constraints. The input signal waveform and IRS passive beamforming phase shifts are jointly designed as a function of users' individual frequency-selective channel state information (CSI). The energy harvester nonlinearity is explored and two IRS deployment schemes, namely frequency selective IRS (FS-IRS) and frequency flat IRS (FF-IRS), are modeled and analyzed. This paper highlights the fact that IRS can provide an extra passive beamforming gain on output DC power over conventional WPT designs and significantly influence the waveform design by leveraging the benefit of passive beamforming, frequency diversity and energy harvester nonlinearity. Even though FF-IRS exhibits lower output DC current than FS-IRS, it still achieves substantially increased DC power over conventional WPT designs. Performance evaluations confirm the significant benefits of a joint waveform and passive beamforming design accounting for the energy harvester nonlinearity to boost the performance of single-user and multi-user WPT system.},

abstract = {MIMO processing plays a central part in the recent increase in spectral and energy efficiencies of wireless networks. MIMO has grown beyond the original point-to-point channel and nowadays refers to a diverse range of centralized and distributed deployments. The fundamental bottleneck toward enormous spectral and energy efficiency benefits in multiuser MIMO networks lies in a huge demand for accurate CSIT. This has become increasingly difficult to satisfy due to the increasing number of antennas and access points in next generation wireless networks relying on dense heterogeneous networks and transmitters equipped with a large number of antennas. CSIT inaccuracy results in a multi-user interference problem that is the primary bottleneck of MIMO wireless networks. Looking backward, the problem has been to strive to apply techniques designed for perfect CSIT to scenarios with imperfect CSIT. In this article, we depart from this conventional approach and introduce readers to a promising strategy based on rate-splitting. Rate-splitting relies on the transmission of common and private messages, and is shown to provide significant benefits in terms of spectral and energy efficiencies, reliability, and CSI feedback overhead reduction over conventional strategies used in LTE-A and exclusively relying on private message transmissions. Open problems, the impact on standard specifications, and operational challenges are also discussed.},

abstract = {We study the effect of channel fading in wireless power transfer (WPT) and show that fading enhances the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of nonlinear RF energy harvesters. We then develop a new form of signal design for WPT, denoted as transmit diversity, that relies on multiple dumb antennas at the transmitter to induce fast fluctuations of the wireless channel. Those fluctuations boost the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency thanks to the energy harvester nonlinearity. In contrast with (energy) beamforming, transmit diversity does not rely on channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and does not increase the average power at the energy harvester input, even though it still enhances the overall end-to-end power transfer efficiency. Transmit diversity is also combined with recently developed (energy) waveform and modulation to provide further enhancements. The efficacy of the scheme is analyzed using physics-based and curve fitting-based nonlinear models of the energy harvester and demonstrated using circuit simulations, prototyping and experimentation. Measurements with two transmit antennas reveal gains of 50% in harvested DC power over a single transmit antenna setup. The work (again) highlights the crucial role played by the harvester nonlinearity and demonstrates that multiple transmit antennas can be beneficial to WPT even in the absence of CSIT.},

abstract = {Communication primitives such as coding and multiple antenna processing have provided significant benefits for traditional wireless systems. Existing designs, however, consume significant power and computational resources, and hence cannot be run on low complexity, power constrained backscatter devices. This paper makes two main contributions: (1) we introduce the first multi-antenna cancellation design that operates on backscatter devices while retaining a small form factor and power footprint, (2) we introduce a novel coding mechanism that enables long range communication as well as concurrent transmissions and can be decoded on backscatter devices. We build hardware prototypes of the above designs that can be powered solely using harvested energy from TV and solar sources. The results show that our designs provide benefits for both RFID and ambient backscatter systems: they enable RFID tags to communicate directly with each other at distances of tens of meters and through multiple walls. They also increase the communication rate and range achieved by ambient backscatter systems by 100X and 40X respectively. We believe that this paper represents a substantial leap in the capabilities of backscatter communication.},

Different from such works, in this work, we consider the realistic and practical scenario of nonlinear energy harvesting. Furthermore, to characterize the R-E tradeoff with nonlinear energy harvesting, we propose a new SWIPT scheme, the generalized OPS (GOPS). As a special case of the proposed GOPS, we also investigate an additional SWIPT scheme, the type-II OPS. Through the analysis based on the realistic nonlinear models reported in the literature, we derive new theoretical results on the R-E tradeoff, which are in sharp contrast to those in the existing literature obtained with linear energy harvesting. Furthermore, we provide various useful insights into the SWIPT system with nonlinear energy harvesting.},

In this paper, we propose a novel energy efficient cooperative communication scheme (EECCS), which combines energy beamforming communication and ambient backscatter communication, to overcome the energy problem of WSNs powered by ambient RF energy harvesting. Moreover, to further reduce the energy consumption of nodes, we present an optimal resource allocation problem for EECCS. It can be formulated as a signomial geometric programming (SGP), which is nonconvex and NP-hard. We develop a Sequential Convex Approximation (SCA) algorithm for finding a solution of this SGP problem, which transforms the SGP problem into a sequence of geometric programming (GP) problems that are convex. The simulation results indicate that the EECCS can improve the energy efficiency of the ambient RF powered WSNs and maximize the total amount of data received by the sink.},

RF harvested power is modeled as an arbitrary nonlinear, continuous, and non-decreasing function of received power, taking into account limited sensitivity and saturation effects. RF harvester's sensitivity may be several dBs worse than communications receiver's sensitivity, potentially rendering RF information signals useless for energy harvesting purposes. Given finite number of datapoint pairs of harvested (output) power and corresponding input power, a piecewise linear approximation is applied and the statistics of the harvested power are offered, as a function of the wireless channel fading statistics. Limited number of datapoints are needed and accuracy analysis is also provided. Case studies include duty-cycled (non-continuous), as well as continuous SWIPT, comparing with industry-level, RF harvesting. The proposed approximation, even though simple, offers accurate performance for all studied metrics. On the other hand, linear models or nonlinear-unlimited sensitivity harvesting models deviate from reality, especially in the low-input-power regime. The proposed methodology can be utilized in current and future SWIPT research.},

Specifically, we build up a theoretical model for a communication system which consists of one reader and one tag. The tag employs ambient backscatter to communicate with the reader. Next we design an optimal detector which can minimize the BER and find the closed-form expression for the detection threshold. Noting that the optimal detector cannot result in equal BERs in detect '0' or '1', therefore we design another detector that can achieve the same error probability in detecting '0' with that in detecting '1'. Moreover, we analyse the BER performance for both detectors. Finally, simulations are provided to corroborate the proposed studies.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the non-coherent detection in ambient backscatter communication, which is highly appealing for systems where the trade-off between signaling overhead and the actual data transmission is very critical. Modeling the time-selective fading channel as a first-order autoregressive (AR) process, we propose a new receiver architecture based on the direct averaging of the received signal samples for detection, which departs significantly from the energy averaging-based receivers considered in the literature. For the proposed setup, we characterize the exact asymptotic bit error rate (BER) for both single-antenna (SA) and multi-antenna (MA) receivers, and demonstrate the robustness of the new architecture to timing errors. Our results demonstrate that while the direct-link (DL) interference from the ambient power source leads to a BER floor in the SA receiver, the MA receiver can remove this interference by estimating the angle of arrival (AoA) of the DL. The analysis further quantifies the effect of improved angular resolution on the BER as a function of the number of receive antennas. A key intermediate result of our analysis is the derivation of a new concentration result for a general sum sequence that is central to the derivation of the conditional distributions of the received signal.},

abstract = {In this paper, we take a critical and fresh look at the downlink multi-antenna NOMA literature. Instead of contrasting NOMA with OMA, we contrast NOMA with two other baselines. The first is conventional Multi-User Linear Precoding (MULP). The second is Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) based on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) and SIC. We show that there is some confusion about the benefits of NOMA, and we dispel the associated misconceptions. First, we highlight why NOMA is inefficient in multi-antenna settings based on basic multiplexing gain analysis. We stress that the issue lies in how the NOMA literature has been hastily applied to multi-antenna setups, resulting in a misuse of spatial dimensions and therefore loss in multiplexing gains and rate. Second, we show that NOMA incurs a severe multiplexing gain loss despite an increased receiver complexity due to an inefficient use of SIC receivers. Third, we emphasize that much of the merits of NOMA are due to the constant comparison to OMA instead of comparing it to MULP and RS baselines. We then expose the pivotal design constraint that multi-antenna NOMA requires one user to fully decode the messages of the other users. This design constraint is responsible for the multiplexing gain erosion, rate loss, and inefficient use of SIC receivers in multi-antenna settings. Our results confirm that NOMA should not be applied blindly to multi-antenna settings, highlight the scenarios where MULP outperforms NOMA and vice versa, and demonstrate the inefficiency, performance loss and complexity disadvantages of NOMA compared to RS. The first takeaway message is that, while NOMA is not beneficial in most multi-antenna deployments. The second takeaway message is that other non-orthogonal transmission frameworks, such as RS, exist which fully exploit the multiplexing gain and the benefits of SIC to boost the rate in multi-antenna settings.},

It is surprisingly found that the channel capacity is obtained when the RF signals are not equiprobably backscattered by tag, and that the capacity with complex Gaussian RF signals is not exactly twice that with real ones for the ambient backscatter communication systems. Then, the outage probability and its asymptotic value in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime are obtained.

In this paper, a modulation scheme based on asymmetric phase-shift keying (PSK) is considered, which improves the SWIPT rate-energy trade-off region significantly. The nonlinear rectifier model, which accurately models the energy harvester, is adopted for evaluating the output direct current (DC) power at the receiver. The harvested DC power is maximized under an average power constraint at the transmitter and a constraint on the rate of information transmitted via a multi-carrier signal over a flat fading channel. As a consequence of the rectifier nonlinearity, this work highlights that asymmetric PSK modulation provides benefits over conventional symmetric PSK modulation in SWIPT and opens the door to systematic modulation design tailored for SWIPT.},

This is done by assigning each user a set of subcarriers and by determining the number of bits and the transmit power level for each subcarrier. We obtain the performance of our proposed algorithm in a multiuser frequency selective fading environment for various time delay spread values and various numbers of users. The results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms multiuser OFDM systems with static time-division multiple access (TDMA) or frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) techniques which employ fixed and predetermined time-slot or subcarrier allocation schemes. We have also quantified the improvement in terms of the overall required transmit power, the bit-error rate (BER), or the area of coverage for a given outage probability.},

In this paper, an EE-based maximization resource allocation (RA) problem is studied in a downlink orthogonal frequency division multiple access-based WP-BackComNet, where the circuit power consumption of the backscatter device, the minimum energy harvesting (EH) constraint, and the maximum transmit power constraint of the power station are considered. To deal with the non-convex problem, we firstly transform it into an equivalently subtractive form via Dinkelbach's method. Then, we apply a variable substitution approach to transform the non-convex problem into a convex one, where the closed-form solutions of the reflection coefficient, the transmit power, and the EH time are deduced by using Lagrange dual method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve better EE performance than other benchmark algorithms.},

To address this issue, we propose a novel rate-splitting NOMA scheme in this paper. In particular, each user information is 'split' into multiple flows, which equivalently form multiple virtual users. These information flows can be successively decoded with even the same arriving power, thus avoiding user paring and significantly reducing the scheduling complexity. We derive the exact closed-form expressions of the outage probability and achievable sum rate of the proposed scheme. Moreover, we provide a practical method to optimize the key parameters, i.e., rate splitting pattern and power spitting pattern, so as to further improve the performance. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {This paper considers transmit optimization in multi-input multi-output (MIMO) wiretap channels, wherein we aim at maximizing the secrecy capacity or rate of an MIMO channel overheard by one or multiple eavesdroppers. Such optimization problems are nonconvex, and appear to be difficult especially in the multi-eavesdropper scenario. In this paper, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) approach to tackle these secrecy optimization problems. We first consider the secrecy capacity maximization (SCM) problem in the single eavesdropper scenario. An AO algorithm is derived through a judicious SCM reformulation. The algorithm conducts some kind of reweighting and water-filling in an alternating fashion, and thus is computationally efficient to implement. We also prove that the AO algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the SCM problem. Then, we turn our attention to the multiple eavesdropper scenario, where the artificial noise (AN)-aided secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is considered. Although the AN-aided SRM problem has a more complex problem structure than the previous SCM, we show that AO can be extended to deal with the former, wherein the problem is handled by solving convex problems in an alternating fashion. Again, the resulting AO method is proven to have KKT point convergence guarantee. For fast implementation, a custom-designed AO algorithm based on smoothing and projected gradient is also derived. The secrecy rate performance and computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by simulations. {\textcopyright} 1983-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {As artificial structures, metamaterials are usually described by macroscopic effective medium parameters, which are named as "analog metamaterials". Here, we propose "digital metamaterials" in two steps. Firstly, we present "coding metamaterials" that are composed of only two kinds of unit cells with 0 and {\pi} phase responses, which we name as "0" and "1" elements. By coding "0" and "1" elements with controlled sequences (i.e., 1-bit coding), we can manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves and realize different functionalities. The concept of coding metamaterial can be extended from 1-bit coding to 2-bit or more. In 2-bit coding, four kinds of unit cells with phase responses 0, {\pi}/2, {\pi}, and 3{\pi}/2 are required to mimic "00", "01", "10" and "11" elements, which have larger freedom to control EM waves. Secondly, we propose a unique metamaterial particle which has either "0" or "1" response controlled by a biased diode. Based on the particle, we present "digital metamaterials" with unit cells having either "0" or "1" state. Using the field-programmable gate array, we realize to control the digital metamaterial digitally. By programming different coding sequences, a single digital metamaterial has distinct abilities in manipulating EM waves, realizing the "programming metamaterials". The above concepts and physical phenomena are confirmed by numerical simulations and experiments through metasurfaces.},

abstract = {In this paper, a backscatter cooperation (BC) scheme is proposed for non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink transmission. The key idea is to backscatter the surplus power of the received downlink signals at one user to enhance the reception of the user who cannot recover its information. To evaluate the performance of the proposed BC-NOMA scheme, three benchmark schemes are introduced, which include the non-cooperation (NC)-NOMA scheme, the conventional relaying (CR)-NOMA scheme, and the incremental relaying (IR)-NOMA scheme. For all these schemes, the outage performance, the expected rate, and the diversity-multiplexing trade-off (DMT) performance are analyzed. Additionally, the optimal power allocation to maximize the expected rate of the BC-NOMA scheme in the high signal-to-noise ratio region is derived. The theoretical results show that the proposed BC-NOMA can enhance both transmission reliability (outage performance) and transmission effectiveness (expected rate) compared with NC-NOMA. Furthermore, representative numerical results are presented to validate the theoretical results. It is shown that unlike the two relaying-based cooperative schemes (CR/IR-NOMA), which improve the outage performance at the cost of transmission rate, the proposed BC-NOMA scheme can enhance the transmission reliability without impairing the spectrum efficiency, which makes backscattering an appealing solution to cooperative NOMA downlinks.},

However, owing to the resource-limitations of passive tags, the efficient usage of multiple antennas at the reader is essential for both downlink excitation and uplink detection. This work targets at maximizing the achievable sum-backscattered-throughput by jointly optimizing the transceiver (TRX) design at the reader and backscattering coefficients (BC) at the tags. Since, this joint problem is nonconvex, we first present individually-optimal designs for the TRX and BC. We show that with precoder and combiner designs at the reader respectively targeting downlink energy beamforming and uplink Wiener filtering operations, the BC optimization at tags can be reduced to a binary power control problem. Next, the asymptotically-optimal joint-TRX-BC designs are proposed for both low and high signal-to-noise-ratio regimes. Based on these developments, an iterative low-complexity algorithm is proposed to yield an efficient jointly-suboptimal design. Thereafter, we discuss the practical utility of the proposed designs to other application settings like wireless powered communication networks and BSC with imperfect channel state information. Lastly, selected numerical results, validating the analysis and shedding novel insights, demonstrate that the proposed designs can yield significant enhancement in the sum-backscattered throughput over existing benchmarks.},

abstract = {Green low power networking with the least requirement of dedicated radio resources is need of the hour which has led to the upsurge of backscatter communication (BSC) technology. However, this inherent potential of BSC is challenged by hardware constraints of the underlying tags. We address this timely concern by investigating the practical efficacy of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology in overcoming the fundamental limitations of BSC. Specifically, we first introduce a novel least-squares based channel estimation (CE) protocol for multi-tag BSC settings that takes care of both the unintended ambient reflections and the inability of tags in performing estimation by themselves. Then using it, a nontrivial low-complexity algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal transceiver designs for the multiantenna reader to maximize the minimum value of the lower-bounded backscattered throughput among the single-antenna semi-passive tags. Additional analytical insights on both individually and jointly-optimal precoding vector and detector matrix at the reader are provided by exploring the asymptotically-optimal transceiver designs. Lastly detailed numerical investigation is carried out to validate the theoretical results and quantify the practically realizable throughput fairness. Specifically, more than seven-fold increase in the common-backscattered-throughput among tags as achieved by the proposed designs over the relevant benchmarks corroborates their practical significance.},

We consider frame-based transmissions. Each frame is divided into three phases: the uplink channel estimation (CE) phase, the downlink WET phase, as well as the uplink wireless information transmission (WIT) phase. Firstly, users use a fraction of the previously harvested energy to send pilots, while the H-AP estimates the uplink channels and obtains the downlink channels by exploiting channel reciprocity. Next, the H-AP utilizes the channel estimates just obtained to transfer wireless energy to all users in the downlink via energy beamforming. Finally, the users use a portion of the harvested energy to send data to the H-AP simultaneously in the uplink (reserving some harvested energy for sending pilots in the next frame). To optimize the throughput and ensure rate fairness, we consider the problem of maximizing the minimum rate among all users. In the large- M regime, we obtain the asymptotically optimal solutions and some interesting insights for the optimal design of WET-MM system.},

In this paper, we consider a cooperative cognitive backscatter network (CCBN) consisting of a multi-antenna RF-Source, multiple (ambient) BDs, and a multi-antenna cooperative receiver (C-RX). We derive the achievable rates for the C-RX decoding the direct-link signal from the RF-Source and the backscatter-link signal from all BDs, respectively. We further formulate an optimization problem to maximize the backscatter-link sum rate by optimizing the beamforming weights (i.e., the precoding matrix) subject to the RF-Source's minimum rate requirement and the BDs' minimum energy requirements. Based on the sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method, we propose an algorithm to find the optimal solution to the original non-convex problem, by using a sequence of semidefinite programming (SDP) problems to approximate the original problem iteratively. Finally, extensive numerical results show that the optimal beamforming solution enhances the BDs' sum rate significantly compared to the omnidirectional transmission, and demonstrate the tradeoff among the direct-link rate of the RF-Source, the sum rate of all BDs, as well as the energy requirements at the BDs.},

It predicts the overall conversion efficiency at Iow power levels where the diodes are operating near their threshold voltage. The output electrical behavior of the rectifier is calculated as a function of the received power and the antenna parameters. Moreover, the two-port parameter values are computed for particular input voltages and output currents for the complete N-stage rectifier circuit using only the measured I-V and C-V characteristics of a single diode. To validate the model a three-stage modified-Greinacher full-wave rectifier was realized in an silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) CMOS 0.5-$\mu$m technology. The measurements are in excellent agreement with the values calculated using the presented model. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {For many years, wireless RF power transmission has been investigated as a viable method of power delivery in a wide array of applications, from high-power space solar power satellites to low-power wireless sensors. However, until recently, efficient application at the low sub-milliwatt power levels has not been realized due to limitations in available control circuitry. This paper presents a smart microcontroller-based power management system with online power stage efficiency optimization and maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The system is experimentally evaluated using a new, more accurate four-quadrant rectenna model and circuit realization that enables rigorous testing of the power management system for a wide range of rectenna arrays and power characteristics. Hardware results are presented with online optimization over a converter input power range from 10 $\mu$W to 1 mW. Results are also shown based on the application of harvesting RF power from a nearby cellular tower, where the power management system collects up to seven times more energy when compared to a direct battery connection. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

@article{Hanif2016,
abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems have the potential to deliver higher system throughput, compared with contemporary orthogonal multiple access techniques. For a linearly precoded multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, we study the downlink sum rate maximization problem, when the NOMA principle is applied. Being a non-convex and intractable optimization problem, we resort to approximate it with a minorization-maximization algorithm (MMA), which is a widely used tool in statistics. In each step of the MMA, we solve a second-order cone program, such that the feasibility set in each step contains that of the previous one, and is always guaranteed to be a subset of the feasibility set of the original problem. It should be noted that the algorithm takes a few iterations to converge. Furthermore, we study the conditions under which the achievable rates maximization can be further simplified to a low complexity design problem, and we compute the probability of occurrence of this event. Numerical examples are conducted to show a comparison of the proposed approach against conventional multiple access systems.},

@article{Hu2015a,
abstract = {Backscatter provides dual-benefits of energy harvesting and low-power communication, making it attractive to a broad class of wireless sensors. But the design of a protocol that enables extremely power-efficient radios for harvesting-based sensors as well as high-rate data transfer for data-rich sensors presents a conundrum. In this paper, we present a new {\em fully asymmetric} backscatter communication protocol where nodes blindly transmit data as and when they sense. This model enables fully flexible node designs, from extraordinarily power-efficient backscatter radios that consume barely a few micro-watts to high-throughput radios that can stream at hundreds of Kbps while consuming a paltry tens of micro-watts. The challenge, however, lies in decoding concurrent streams at the reader, which we achieve using a novel combination of time-domain separation of interleaved signal edges, and phase-domain separation of colliding transmissions. We provide an implementation of our protocol, LF-Backscatter, and show that it can achieve an order of magnitude or more improvement in throughput, latency and power over state-of-art alternatives.},

abstract = {An intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) consists of a large number of low-cost reflecting elements, which can steer the incident signal collaboratively by passive beamforming. This way, IRS reconfigures the wireless environment to boost the system performance. In this letter, we consider an IRS-assisted uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. The objective is to maximize the sum rate of all users under individual power constraint. The considered problem requires a joint power control at the users and beamforming design at the IRS, and is non-convex. To handle it, semidefinite relaxation is employed, which provides a near-optimal solution. Presented numerical results show that the proposed NOMA-based scheme achieves a larger sum rate than orthogonal multiple access (OMA)-based one. Moreover, the impact of the number of reflecting elements on the sum rate is revealed.},

Despite its widespread use, precise specification of the transmit power of USRP SDR boards is not readily available in the manufacturer data sheets, and in this paper we present an experimental study of the transmit power for the B-series USRP SDR board from Ettus Research. Specifically, a USRP B200 SDR is used to setup extensive measurements of the output transmit power over its covered frequency range and the power variation with frequency along with its dependence on the transmit gain parameter in the USRP hardware driver (UHD) is evaluated. A discussion of the possible causes that lead to variations in the transmit power is also presented.},
