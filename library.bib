	abstract  = {Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) is intended to supplant legacy (optical) bar code scanning technology found in many logistic and retail applications. RFID is distinguished by inexpensive, low power and compact form factor tags, whose longevity and efficacy are predicated on using passive communication techniques and on-tag power harvesting. Such tags employ backscatter modulation, which does not require any active RF components. As a result, backscatter has become an attractive design choice for short-range communications in power constrained wireless sensor networking scenarios. The purpose of this work is two-fold. First, it aims to expose backscatter communication as an emerging topic to a communication systems-theoretic audience. Since backscatter modulation and on-tag power harvesting efficiency are coupled, it is necessary to re-examine notions of power and spectral efficiency from an energy-constraint perspective; this leads to novel coded modulation schemes for future RFID systems. Further, we investigate RFID MIMO systems where the channel fading encountered has different statistics than the classical Rayleigh fading model. In turn,the trade off between diversity order and spatial multiplexing gains are distinct from wide-area MIMO. ©2014 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Backscatter radio is proposed for sensor networks. In that way, the transmitter for each sensor is simplified to a transistor connected to an antenna and therefore, the cost for each sensor's communicator becomes negligible, while energy used for wireless communication per sensor is minimized. A software-defined transceiver is built to transmit a carrier, receive the reflections from various sensors and extract their transmitted messages. This work presents a thorough model of the backscatter radio link, the system architecture and a set of data extraction techniques for each sensor's information, testing in practice a sensor communicating through backscatter at a range of approximately 15 meters indoors, with 5 milliwatt transmission power at 10 bits per second. This work highlights the idiosyncrasies of the backscatter channel and provides a new communication perspective in the fertile area of scalable sensor networks, especially when low bit-rate, ultra-low cost sensors are required. ©2008 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The heterogenous wireless services and exponentially growing traffic call for novel spectrum- and energy-efficient wireless communication technologies. Recently, a new technique, called symbiotic radio (SR), is proposed to exploit the benefits and address the drawbacks of cognitive radio (CR) and ambient backscattering communications (AmBC), leading to mutualism spectrum sharing and highly reliable backscattering communications. In particular, the secondary transmitter (STx) in SR transmits messages to the secondary receiver (SRx) over the RF signals originating from the primary transmitter (PTx) based on cognitive backscattering communications, thus the secondary system shares not only the radio spectrum, but also the power, and infrastructure with the primary system. In return, the secondary transmission provides beneficial multipath diversity to the primary system, therefore the two systems form mutualism spectrum sharing. More importantly, joint decoding is exploited at SRx to achieve highly reliable backscattering communications. In this article, to exploit the full potential of SR, we provide a systematic view for SR and address three fundamental tasks in SR: (1) enhancing the backscattering link via active load; (2) achieving highly reliable communications through joint decoding; and (3) capturing PTx's RF signals using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces. Emerging applications, design challenges and open research problems will also be discussed.},

By smartly tuning the signal reflection via a large number of low-cost passive reflecting elements, IRS is capable of dynamically altering wireless channels to enhance the communication performance. It is thus expected that the new IRS-aided hybrid wireless network comprising both active and passive components will be highly promising to achieve a sustainable capacity growth cost-effectively in the future. Despite its great potential, IRS faces new challenges to be efficiently integrated into wireless networks, such as reflection optimization, channel estimation, and deployment from communication design perspectives. In this paper, we provide a tutorial overview of IRS-aided wireless communications to address the above issues, and elaborate its reflection and channel models, hardware architecture and practical constraints, as well as various appealing applications in wireless networks.

For each scheme, the optimal reflection coefficient or the optimal primary transmit power are derived and closed-form expressions of outage probability are then developed for both primary and backscatter systems. Also, asymptotic outage behavior is characterized in the high transmit signal-To-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Our analysis shows that for the backscatter system, both parasitic and competitive schemes achieve the same outage probability which is irrelevant to the backscatter channels, whereas the commensal scheme can attain exactly the same asymptotic outage performance with the other two schemes at high transmit SNR. In addition, as the SNR threshold of the backscatter system approaches to zero, the three schemes can achieve the same outage performance for the backscatter system. Finally, the theoretical results are validated via Monte-Carlo simulations.},

The primary transmitter (PT) is designed to assist both the primary and BD transmissions, and the primary receiver (PR) is used to decode the information from the PT as well as the BD. The symbol period for BD transmission is assumed to be either equal to or much greater than that of the primary one, resulting in parasitic SR (PSR) or commensal SR (CSR) setup. We consider a basic SR system which consists of three nodes: 1) a multiantenna PT; 2) a single-antenna BD; and 3) a single-antenna PR. We first derive the achievable rates for the primary and BD transmissions for each setup. Then, we formulate two transmit beamforming optimization problems, i.e., the weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) problem and the transmit power minimization (TPM) problem, and solve these nonconvex problems by applying the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. In addition, a novel transmit beamforming structure is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the solutions. The simulation results show that for CSR setup, the proposed solution enables the opportunistic transmission for the BD via energy-efficient passive backscattering without any loss in spectral efficiency, by properly exploiting the additional signal path from the BD.},

In return, the primary communication link can be enhanced by the additional multipaths created by the BD. This is known as the mutualism relationship of symbiotic radio. However, as the backscattering link is much weaker than the direct link due to double attenuations, the improvement of the primary link brought by one single BD is extremely limited. To address this issue and enable full mutualism of symbiotic radio, in this paper, we study symbiotic radio with massive number of BDs. For symbiotic radio multiple access channel (MAC) with successive interference cancellation (SIC), we first derive the achievable rate of both the primary and secondary communications, based on which a receive beamforming optimization problem is formulated and solved. Furthermore, considering the asymptotic regime of massive number of BDs, closed-form expressions are derived for the primary and the secondary communication rates, both of which are shown to be increasing functions of the number of BDs. This thus demonstrates that the mutualism relationship of symbiotic radio can be fully exploited with massive BD access.},

In this paper, we propose a cooperative AmBC (CABC) system in which the reader recovers information not only from the A-BD, but also from the RF source. We first establish the system model for the CABC system from spread spectrum and spectrum sharing perspectives. Then, for flat fading channels, we derive the optimal maximumlikelihood (ML) detector, suboptimal linear detectors as well as successive interference-cancellation (SIC) based detectors. For frequency-selective fading channels, the system model for the CABC system over ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) carriers is proposed, upon which a low-complexity optimal ML detector is derived. For both kinds of channels, the bit-error-rate (BER) expressions for the proposed detectors are derived in closed forms. Finally, extensive numerical results have shown that, when the A-BD signal and the RF-source signal have equal symbol period, the proposed SIC-based detectors can achieve near-ML detection performance for typical application scenarios, and when the A-BD symbol period is longer than the RF-source symbol period, the existence of backscattered signal in the CABC system can enhance the ML detection performance of the RFsource signal, thanks to the beneficial effect of the backscatter link when the A-BD transmits at a lower rate than the RF source.},

All proposed techniques are based on simple, but careful, switching frequency control at the tag, allowing for the easy frequency-domain multiple access. First, a digital modulation scheme is offered, namely pseudo-frequency shift keying, assuming illumination from constant envelope-modulated signals and a fully coherent detector is derived along with closed-form probability of error. A second digital modulation scheme is also offered, based on a frequency-shifted form of binary phase shift keying (S-BPSK), relaxing the constant-envelope requirement for the illuminator and an illumination-agnostic detector is derived. Based on S-BPSK, short packet error correction coding is utilized for ambient backscatter communication, for the first time in the literature. It is shown that the proposed coded scheme under modulated ambient signal illumination & wireless channel variation, offers tremendous performance gains, i.e., modulation of the ambient signal is helpful. Finally, a third, purely analog, modulation scheme is analyzed, based on FM remodulation principles. A low-cost tag is implemented, demonstrating tag-toreceiver ranges up to 26 meters outdoors, power consumption of 24 μWatts in continuous operation, able to be interrogated by any conventional frequency modulation (FM) receiver. The proposed techniques cover a large variety of omnipresent wireless industry systems, enabling universal ambient backscatter and relevant wireless information and power transfer (WIPT) applications.},

   abstract = {Spectrum sensing is a key enabling technique for cognitive radio (CR), which provides essential information on the spectrum availability. However, due to severe wireless channel fading and path loss, the primary user (PU) signals received at the CR or secondary user (SU) can be practically too weak for reliable detection. To tackle this issue, we consider in this letter a new intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided spectrum sensing scheme for CR, by exploiting the large aperture and passive beamforming gains of IRS to boost the PU signal strength received at the SU to facilitate its spectrum sensing. Specifically, by dynamically changing the IRS reflection over time according to a given codebook, its reflected signal power varies substantially at the SU, which is utilized for opportunistic signal detection. Furthermore, we propose a weighted energy detection method by combining the received signal power values over different IRS reflections, which significantly improves the detection performance. Simulation results validate the performance gain of the proposed IRS-aided spectrum sensing scheme, as compared to different benchmark schemes.},

In this letter, we consider the integration of IRS to an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) based multiuser downlink communication system, and study the pertinent joint optimization of the IRS reflection coefficients and OFDMA time-frequency resource block as well as power allocations to maximize the users' common (minimum) rate. Specifically, due to the lack of frequency-selective passive beamforming capability at the IRS, only one set of reflection coefficients can be designed for adapting to a large number of channels of multiple users over different frequency sub-bands. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a novel dynamic passive beamforming scheme where the IRS reflection coefficients are dynamically adjusted over different time slots within each channel coherence block to create artificial time-varying channels and select only a subset of the users to be simultaneously served in each time slot, thus achieving a higher passive beamforming gain. Although the formulated optimization problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to it. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the system common rate over the setup without IRS and that with random IRS reflection coefficients. Moreover, our proposed dynamic passive beamforming outperforms the fixed passive beamforming which employs a common set of reflection coefficients in each channel coherence block, by more flexibly balancing between passive beamforming and multiuser diversity gains.},

To this end, we first study three special cases of the dynamic IRS beamforming,namely user-adaptive IRS beamforming, UL-adaptive IRS beamforming, and static IRS beamforming,by characterizing their optimal performance relationships and proposing corresponding algorithms. Interestingly, it is rigorously proved that the latter two cases achieve the same throughput, thus helping halve the number of IRS phase shifts to be optimized and signalling overhead practically required for UL-adaptive IRS beamforming.

Particularly, we propose three types of IRS beamforming configurations to strike a balance between the system performance and signaling overhead as well as implementation complexity. We first propose the fully dynamic IRS beamforming, where the IRS phase-shift vectors vary with each time slot for both DL wireless energy transfer (WET) and UL wireless information transmission (WIT). To further reduce signaling overhead and implementation complexity, we then study two special cases, namely, partially dynamic IRS beamforming and static IRS beamforming. For the former case, two different phase-shift vectors can be exploited for the DL WET and the UL WIT, respectively, whereas for the latter case, the same phase-shift vector needs to be applied for both DL and UL transmissions. We aim to maximize the system throughput by jointly optimizing the time allocation, HAP transmit power, and IRS phase shifts for the above three cases. Two efficient algorithms based on alternating optimization and penalty-based algorithms are respectively proposed for both perfect self-interference cancellation (SIC) case and imperfect SIC case by applying successive convex approximation and difference-of-convex optimization techniques.

In addition, a novel signaling strategy based on layered encoding is proposed that enables practical successive cancellation-type decoding at the receiver.

Recently, the brand-new concept of utilizing IRS to implement a passive transmitter attracts researchers' attention since it potentially realizes low-complexity and hardware-efficient transmitters of multiple-input single/multiple-output (MISO/MIMO) systems. In this paper we investigate the problem of precoder design for a low-resolution IRS-based transmitter to implement multiuser MISO/MIMO wireless communications. Particularly, the IRS modulates information symbols by varying the phases of its reflecting elements and transmits them to K single-antenna or multi-antenna users. We first aim to design the symbol-level precoder for IRS to realize the modulation and minimize the maximum symbol-error-rate (SER) of single-antenna receivers. In order to tackle this NP-hard problem, we first relax the low-resolution phase-shift constraint and solve this problem by Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) algorithm. Then, the low-resolution symbol-level precoding vector is obtained by direct quantization. Considering the large quantization error for 1-bit resolution case, the branch-and-bound method is utilized to solve the 1-bit resolution symbol-level precoding vector. For multi-antenna receivers, we propose to iteratively design the symbol-level precoder and combiner by decomposing the original large-scale optimization problem into several sub-problems.

Simulation results show that RIS-RQRM outperforms the existing counterparts without I/Q index modulation in terms of BER in the low signal-to-noise ratio region.},

Different from existing methods ideally assuming the secondary user (SU) can jointly decode information symbols from both the access point (AP) and the IRS via multiuser detection, we consider a more practical SU that only non-coherent detection is available. To characterize the non-coherent decoding performance, a practical upper bound of the average symbol error rate (SER) is derived. Subsequently, we jointly optimize the beamformer at the AP and the phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the average sum-rate of the primary system taking into account the maximum tolerable SER constraint for the SU. To circumvent the couplings of variables, we exploit the Schur complement that facilitates the design of a suboptimal beamforming algorithm based on successive convex approximation. Our simulation results show that compared with various benchmark algorithms, the proposed scheme significantly improves the average sum-rate of the primary system, while guaranteeing the decoding performance of the secondary system.},

   abstract = {In a backscatter communication system, the backscatter device (BD) transmits its messages to the backscatter receiver (BR) by reflecting the incident signal from an external radio frequency (RF) emitter, instead of using power-hungry active RF components themselves. Thus, backscatter communication has shown great potential for achieving low-power communication. The double-fading effect associated with the backscatter link, however, is a major limiting factor to achieve efficient backscatter communication. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), a recently developed technology, can be applied at the BD to enhance the backscatter link thanks to the fact that both RIS and backscatter communication share the same reflective principle. Such a design can also allow the backscatter communication system to capture the desired RF signal as a reflective carrier in a complex radio environment. In this article, a comprehensive overview of backscatter communication assisted by RIS is given. We first introduce the basics of backscatter communication, which covers the antenna scattering principle, backscatter modulation, and link budget calculation. Then, the details of RIS are discussed, which include antenna-based RIS and metamaterial-based RIS, followed by the discussion of the roles of RIS in backscatter communication. After that, we provide an overview of three types of backscatter communication systems assisted by RIS, including RIS-assisted unmodulated backscatter communication, RIS-assisted ambient backscatter communication, and RIS-assisted symbiotic radio. Emerging applications of these systems, technical challenges, and future opportunities in this emerging field are also presented.},

   abstract = {Passive and semipassive UHF RF identification (RFID) systems have traditionally been designed using scalar-valued differential radar cross section (DRCS) methods to model the backscattered signal from the tag. This paper argues that scalar-valued DRCS analysis is unnecessarily limiting because of the inherent coherence of the backscatter link and the complex-valued nature of load-dependent antenna-mode scattering from an RFID tag. Considering modulated backscatter in terms of complex-valued scattered fields opens the possibility of quadrature modulation of the backscatter channel. When compared with binary amplitude shift keying (ASK) or phase shift keying (PSK) based RFID systems, which transmit 1 bit of data per symbol period, and thus 1 bit per on-chip clock oscillator period, tags employing vector backscatter modulation can transmit more than 1 bit per symbol period. This increases the data rate for a given on-chip symbol clock rate leading to reduced on-chip power consumption and extended read range. Alternatively, tags employing an -ary modulator can achieve higher data throughput at essentially the same dc power consumption as a tag employing binary ASK or PSK. In contrast to the binary ASK or PSK backscatter modulation employed by passive and semipassive UHF RFID tags, such as tags compliant with the widely used ISO18000-6c standard, this paper explores a novel CMOS-compatible method for generating -ary quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) backscatter modulation. A new method is presented for designing an inductorless -ary QAM backscatter modulator using only an array of switched resistances and capacitances. Device-level simulation and measurements of a four-state phase shift keying (4-PSK)/four-state quadrature amplitude modulated (4-QAM) modulator are provided for a semipassive (battery-assisted) tag operating in the 850-950-MHz band. This first prototype modulator transmits 4-PSK/4-QAM at a symbol rate of 200 kHz and a bit rate of 400 kb/s at a static power dissipation of only 115 nW. ©2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is envisioned to have abundant applications in future wireless networks by smartly reconfiguring the signal propagation for performance enhancement. Specifically, an IRS consists of a large number of low-cost passive elements each reflecting the incident signal with a certain phase shift to collaboratively achieve beamforming and suppress interference at one or more designated receivers. In this paper, we study an IRS-enhanced point-to-point multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless system where one IRS is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to a single-antenna user. As a result, the user simultaneously receives the signal sent directly from the AP as well as that reflected by the IRS. We aim to maximize the total received signal power at the user by jointly optimizing the (active) transmit beamforming at the AP and (passive) reflect beamforming by the phase shifters at the IRS. We first propose a centralized algorithm based on the technique of semidefinite relaxation (SDR) by assuming the global channel state information (CSI) available at the IRS. Since the centralized implementation requires excessive channel estimation and signal exchange overheads, we further propose a low-complexity distributed algorithm where the AP and IRS independently adjust the transmit beamforming and the phase shifts in an alternating manner until the convergence is reached. Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be achieved by the proposed algorithms as compared to benchmark schemes. Moreover, it is verified that the IRS is able to drastically enhance the link quality and/or coverage over the conventional setup without the IRS.},

   abstract = {Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has emerged as a viable technique to energize and connect low-power autonomous devices and enable future Internet of Things (IoT). A major challenge of SWIPT is the energy consumption of the receiver of such low-power devices. An attractive low-power solution consists in an integrated information decoder (ID) and energy harvester (EH) architecture for SWIPT receiver (IntRx) where the received RF signal is first rectified before being used for information decoding. Such architecture eliminates the need for energy-consuming RF components such as local oscillators and mixers. This paper proposes a novel modulation and demodulation method for the IntRx SWIPT architecture based on pulse position modulation (PPM) where information is encoded in the position of the pulse. The new method transmits high amplitude pulses to increase the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal and exploits the EH's nonlinearity so as to boost the harvested DC power. Simultaneously, the information can be decoded from the rectifier signal by simply finding the position of the pulse in a certain symbol duration. We have analyzed both the information and the power transfer performance of the newly proposed PPM for IntRx SWIPT theoretically, numerically, and experimentally. To that end, we have established a SWIPT system testbed in an indoor environment by prototyping a base station to transfer information-power signal and the IntRx SWIPT receiver including ID and EH blocks. The performance evaluation of the PPM was carried out in various conditions, and the results have been compared and contrasted to conventional signals. Theoretical, numerical, and experimental results highlight the significant benefits of the proposed PPM scheme to enhance the power transfer performance and operate information decoding with low-power consumption.},

Is this fact true for a radio system, as well? The question has existed for decades. In this article, the equivalent circuits of antenna systems are reexamined. It is demonstrated that classical equivalent circuit models based on the Thvenin and Norton theorems are not suitable for a receiving antenna system since the antenna cannot be simply approximated by a voltage or current source. A constant power source is required but not readily available. Thus, two new general power source models are introduced and examined. It is found that they may be suitable for a transmitting antenna system but not accurate enough for a receiving antenna when the antenna loss is taken into account. A novel special constant power source model is therefore proposed and shown to accurately simulate the behavior of a receiving antenna. When the load impedance is the complex conjugate of the antenna impedance, maximum power is obtained, and the power transfer efficiency is simultaneously maximized (up to 100\{\%\} if the antenna system is lossless).},

The acquisition of the forward-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER) state information (F-CSI) at the ET (or RFID reader) is challenging, since the ERs (or RFID tags) are typically too energy-and-hardware-constrained to estimate or feedback the F-CSI. The ET leverages its observed backscatter signals to estimate the backscatter-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER-to-ET) state information (BS-CSI) directly. We first analyze the harvested energy obtained using the estimated BS-CSI. Furthermore, we optimize the resource allocation to maximize the total utility of harvested energy. For WET to single ER, we obtain the optimal channel-training energy in a semiclosed form. For WET to multiple ERs, we optimize the channel-training energy and the energy allocation weights for different energy beams. For the straightforward weighted-sum-energy (WSE) maximization, the optimal WET scheme is shown to use only one energy beam, which leads to unfairness among ERs and motivates us to consider the complicated proportional-fair-energy (PFE) maximization. For PFE maximization, we show that it is a biconvex problem, and propose a block-coordinate-descent-based algorithm to find the close-to-optimal solution. Numerical results show that with the optimized solutions, the harvested energy suffers slight reduction of less than 10\{\%\}, compared to that obtained using the perfect F-CSI.},

Backscatter-based sensing requires accurate estimation of a backscatter channel (phase and amplitude), which is distorted when multiple signals collide with each other. As a result, the state of the arts is limited to either parallel decoding of collided signal or channel estimation with clean signal. Motivated by the need of high sensing capacity, we in this article present Fireworks, the first approach for channel estimation of parallel backscattered signals. The insight of Fireworks is that although the channel is distorted due to collision, the movements of the ON-OFF Keying modulated signal still preserve the channel properties of the respective tags. By modeling the relationship between the channels and the signal's moving trajectory in the IQ domain, one can make accurate estimation of the channels directly from the collision. We address practical problems of Fireworks, such as the high computing complexity and the compatibility with the commercial MAC protocol, and implement Fireworks. The results show that Fireworks is able to estimate the channels of up to five tags in parallel. When applied to the tracking application, Fireworks achieves 2sim 4times improvement in the tracking accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art approach.},

To minimize the mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation, we first formulate an optimization problem for designing the IRS reflection pattern in the training phase under the constraints of unit-modulus, discrete phase, and full rank. This problem, however, is NP-hard and thus difficult to solve in general. As such, we propose a low-complexity yet efficient method to solve it sub-optimally, by constructing a near-orthogonal reflection pattern based on either discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-matrix quantization or Hadamard-matrix truncation. Based on the estimated channel, we then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable rate by designing the discrete-phase passive beamforming at the IRS with the training overhead and channel estimation error taken into account. To reduce the computational complexity of exhaustive search, we further propose a low-complexity successive refinement algorithm with a properly-designed initialization to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution.

Interestingly, the complex Gaussian source would cause an error floor, while the PSK source does not, which brings nontrivial indication of constellation design as opposed to popular Gaussian-embedded literatures.

   abstract = {This paper deals with computation of the capacity region of the discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (MAC), which is equivalent to solving a difficult nonconvex optimization problem. In the literature, it is claimed that for elementary MACs, i.e., MACs for which the size of output alphabet is greater or equal to the sizes of all input alphabets, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions provide a necessary and sufficient condition for sum-rate optimality. In this paper, we demonstrate that this claim does not hold, even for two-user channels with binary input and binary output alphabets. Consequently, the capacity computation problem for the discrete MAC remains an interesting and mostly unsolved problem. © 2011 IEEE.},

   abstract = {In this article, under a general cost function C , we present a dynamic programming (DP) method to obtain an optimal sequential deterministic quantizer (SDQ) for q -ary input discrete memoryless channel (DMC). The DP method has complexity O(q (N-M)2 ,M) , where N and M are the alphabet sizes of the DMC output and quantizer output, respectively. Then, starting from the quadrangle inequality, two techniques are applied to reduce the DP method's complexity. One technique makes use of the Shor-Moran-Aggarwal-Wilber-Klawe (SMAWK) algorithm and achieves complexity O(q (N-M) M). The other technique is much easier to be implemented and achieves complexity O(q (N2 - M2)). We further derive a sufficient condition under which the optimal SDQ is optimal among all quantizers and the two techniques are applicable. This generalizes the results in the literature for binary-input DMC. Next, we show that the cost function of α -mutual information ( α -MI)-maximizing quantizer belongs to the category of C. We further prove that under a weaker condition than the sufficient condition we derived, the aforementioned two techniques are applicable to the design of α -MI-maximizing quantizer. Finally, we illustrate the particular application of our design method to practical pulse-amplitude modulation systems.},

A thresholding quantizer is then used to quantize the continuous-valued output U to the final discrete output V. One wants to design a thresholding quantizer that maximizes the mutual information between the input and the final quantized output I(X;V). In this paper, the structure of optimal thresholding quantizer is established that finally results in two efficient algorithms having the time complexities O(NM+K\log^\{2\}(NM)) for finding the local optimal quantizer and O(KM\log(NM)) for finding the global optimal quantizer where N, M, K are the size of input X, received output U and quantized output V, respectively.

   abstract = {Ambient backscatter (AB), making use of both energy harvesting and backscattering, has recently become a promising solution to communications among low-power devices and demonstrates its potential application in the Internet of Things. Existing AB systems adopt two-state amplitude shift keying or phase shift keying (PSK), where data are transmitted at the rate of one bit per symbol period. To increase the data rate, we investigate the high-order modulation where M -PSK is employed for backscattering. We derive the optimal multilevel energy detector and compute the closed-form symbol error rate. To show the realizability of the proposed design, we build a 4PSK-AB hardware prototype, in which the selection of load impedance is discussed with the aid of phasor diagram illustration. The hardware prototype can achieve the date rate of 20 kb/s. Besides, higher date rate is achievable for 98.7% of the time compared with binary AB communications, and the mean number of distinguishable symbols is 3.66.},

   abstract = {The computation of the channel capacity of discrete memoryless channels is a convex problem that can be efficiently solved using the Arimoto-Blahut (AB) iterative algorithm. However, the extension of this algorithm to the computation of capacity regions of multiterminal networks is not straightforward since it gives rise to non-convex problems. In this context, the AB algorithm has only been successfully extended to the calculation of the sum-capacity of the discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (DMAC). Thus, the computation of the whole capacity region still requires the use of computationally demanding search methods. In this paper, we first give an alternative reformulation of the capacity region of the DMAC which condenses all the nonconvexities of the problem into a single rank-one constraint. Then, we propose efficient methods to compute outer and inner bounds on the capacity region of the two-user DMAC by solving a relaxed version of the problem and projecting its solution onto the original feasible set. Targeting numerical results, we first take a randomization approach. Focusing on analytical results, we study projection via minimum divergence, which amounts to the marginalization of the relaxed solution. In this case we derive sufficient conditions and necessary and sufficient conditions for the bounds to be tight. Furthermore, we are able to show that the class of channels for which the marginalization bounds match exactly the capacity region includes all the two-user binaryinput deterministic DMACs as well as other non-deterministic channels. In general, however, both methods are able to compute very tight bounds as shown for various examples.},

   abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a revolutionary and transformative technology for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless communication cost-effectively in the future. Specifically, an IRS consists of a large number of low-cost passive elements each being able to reflect the incident signal independently with an adjustable phase shift so as to collaboratively achieve three-dimensional (3D) passive beamforming without the need of any transmit radio-frequency (RF) chains. In this paper, we study an IRS-aided single-cell wireless system where one IRS is deployed to assist in the communications between a multi-antenna access point (AP) and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate and solve new problems to minimize the total transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming by active antenna array at the AP and reflect beamforming by passive phase shifters at the IRS, subject to users' individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance of IRS's passive beamforming with infinitely large number of reflecting elements and compare it to that of the traditional active beamforming/relaying. Simulation results demonstrate that an IRS-aided MIMO system can achieve the same rate performance as a benchmark massive MIMO system without using IRS, but with significantly reduced active antennas/RF chains. We also draw useful insights into optimally deploying IRS in future wireless systems.},
